2.1.2	A Recognised Body must at all times comply with the requirements of this chapter to the satisfaction of the Regulator. The same standards apply on initial recognition and throughout the period Recognised Body status is held. The term Recognised Body in this Rule and the guidance should be taken to refer also to an Applicant when appropriate.
2.1.3	A Recognised Body must provide all relevant information to the Regulator concerning:
(a)	the constitution, Regulatory Provisions and practices of the Recognised Body;
(b)	the nature (including complexity, diversity and risk) and scale of the Recognised Body's business;

(d)	the nature and status of the types of investor who use the Recognised Body's facilities or have an interest in the market supported by the Recognised Body’s facilities;
(e)	competition in the markets for services provided, or proposed to be provided, by the Recognised Body in its capacity as such; and
(f)	the nature and scale of the risks to the Regulator's objectives associated with the matters described in ‎(a) to ‎(e).
2.2	Suitability 
2.2.1	A Recognised Body must be a fit and proper Person to perform the Regulatory Functions of a Recognised Body. 
2.2.1.Guidance	When determining whether it is a fit and proper Person, a Recognised Body should have regard to all relevant factors including, but not limited to:
(a)	the commitment shown by the Recognised Body's Governing Body to satisfying the Recognition Requirements and to complying with any other applicable obligations;
(b)	its arrangements, policies and resources for fulfilling its obligations in relation to its activities as a Recognised Body, including in relation to the control of conflicts of interest;
(c)	the extent to which its constitution and organisation provide for effective governance and effective oversight by the Governing Body of its relevant Regulatory Functions;
(d)	breaches of any relevant law, regulation or code of practice by the Recognised Body or its Key Individuals; 
(e)	its arrangements for ensuring that it employs individuals who are honest and demonstrate high standards of integrity;

(g)	the independence of the persons responsible for the performance of supervisory functions from its commercial and marketing arms;
(h)	its connections with any undertaking under its control or in its Group, and any Person with a position of influence over, or who effectively runs the business of, the Recognised Body, having regard to:
(i)	the reputation and standing of that other Person, including its standing with the Regulator or any Non-Abu Dhabi Global Market Financial Services Regulator;
(ii)	breaches of any law or regulation by that other Person;
(iii)	the roles of any of the Recognised Body's Key Individuals who have a position within organisations under the control or influence of that other Person, including their responsibilities in that organisation and the extent and type of their access to its Senior Management or Governing Body;
(iv)	the extent to which the Recognised Body operates as a distinct entity notwithstanding its connection with that other Person; and
(v)	the extent to which the Recognised Body's Governing Body is responsible for its day-to-day management and operations,
noting that nothing in this paragraph should be taken to imply any restriction on the ability of a Recognised Body to outsource any function to any Person in a manner consistent with the rules on outsourcing set out in Rule ‎2.14.4.
2.2.2	[Deleted]
2.3	Governance and Key Individuals
2.3.1	Governance . A Recognised Body's Governing Body must comply with the requirements set out in GEN Rules 3.3.41 and 3.3.42.

The Regulator may also make its own determination as to whether any other function in the Recognised Body should be deemed a Regulatory Function, requiring the appointment of a Key Individual to head such function.
2.3.4	Any appointment of a Key Individual by a Recognised Body is subject to approval by the Regulator. 
Determination of application to act as a Key Individual
2.3.5	The Regulator may approve an application for appointment as a Key Individual only if it is satisfied that the person in respect of whom the application is made is a fit and proper person to act as a Key Individual for the Regulatory Function to which the application relates.  
In order to be considered fit and proper, a Key Individual must adhere to the six Principles for Approved Persons set out in GEN 2.4 in respect of every Regulatory Function. 
For the purposes of this Rule and Rule 2.3.8, all references in GEN 2.4 to “Approved Persons” and “Controlled Functions” shall be read as references to “Key Individuals” and “Regulatory Functions” respectively.
2.3.6	The Regulator may approve the Application:
(a)	subject to any conditions that it considers appropriate; and

if it appears to the Regulator that it is desirable to do so in order to further one or more of its objectives.
2.3.7	A Recognised Body that makes an application for approval of a Key Individual may withdraw the application by giving written notice to the Regulator at any time before the Regulator determines it.

Variation of approval at request of Recognised Body
2.3.9	Where an application for approval of a Key Individual is granted subject to one or both of the conditions under Rule 2.3.6, the Recognised Body concerned may apply to the Regulator to vary the approval. The Regulator may then:

2.3.11	The Regulator may vary an approval given in relation to a Key Individual if the Regulator considers that it is desirable to do so in order to further one or more of its objectives.
2.3.12	The Regulator may vary a Key Individual approval by:
(a)	imposing a condition;
(b)	varying a condition;
(c)	removing a condition; or
(d)	limiting the period for which the approval is to have effect.
2.3.13	A condition may, in particular, be imposed so as to require any person to take, or refrain from taking, specified action.
Change of Key Individual
2.3.14	In circumstances where an individual who has been approved as a Key Individual pursuant to Rule 2.3.5 will no longer act as a Key Individual, whether by resignation, withdrawal or variation, the Recognised Body must notify the Regulator in writing within ten Business Days of such resignation, withdrawal or variation, and ensure it continues to satisfy Rule 2.3.2.
2.4	Financial resources
2.4.1	A Recognised Body must have financial resources sufficient for the proper performance of its Regulatory Functions. 
2.4.2	[Deleted]
2.4.2.Guidance	
When determining whether it has financial resources sufficient for the proper performance of its Regulatory Functions, a Recognised Body must take into account all relevant factors, including but not limited to:
(a)	its connection with any Person;
(b)	any activity carried on by it, whether or not is a Regulated Activity conducted by it in its capacity as an Exempt Person;
(c)	the operational and other risks to which it is exposed, including the extent to which, after allowing for the financial resources necessary to cover counterparty and market risks, its financial resources are sufficient and sufficiently liquid to:
(i)	enable the Recognised Body to continue to properly carry on the Regulated Functions that it expects to carry on; and
(ii)	ensure that it would be able to complete an orderly closure or transfer of its Regulated Functions without being prevented from doing so by insolvency or lack of available funds;
(d)	if it guarantees the performance of transactions in Financial Instruments, the counterparty and market risks to which it is exposed in that capacity, including the nature and scale of its exposure and, where relevant, the counterparties to which it is exposed;
(e)	the amount and composition of its capital and liquid financial assets;
(i)	the amount and composition of its other financial resources (such as insurance policies and guarantees, where appropriate); and
(ii)	the financial benefits, liabilities, risks and exposures arising from its connection with any Person, including but not limited to, its connection with:
(A)	any undertaking in the same Group as the Recognised Body;
(B)	any other Person with a significant shareholding or stake in the Recognised Body;
(C)	any other Person with whom it has made a significant investment, whether in the form of equity, debt, or by means of any guarantee or other form of commitment; and
(D)	any Person with whom it has a significant contractual relationship; 
(f)	the likely availability of liquid financial resources to the Recognised Body during periods of major market turbulence or other periods of major stress for the Abu Dhabi Global Market Financial System; and

2.4.3	Capital requirements. A Recognised Investment Exchange must, at all times, hold Capital in accordance with Rule ‎3.2.
2.4.4	Capital requirements. A Recognised Clearing House must, at all times, hold Capital in accordance with Rule ‎4.2.
2.4.5	Capital requirements. "Capital" means Tier 1 capital, as defined in PRU 3.9.
2.4.6	Capital requirements. The Regulator may require a Recognised Body to hold an additional Capital buffer, which may be used only in times of market stress or financial difficulty.

2.4.7	Accounting information and standards. A Recognised Body must prepare and maintain its financial statements in accordance with chapter 6 of GEN.
2.4.8	Accounting information and standards. [Deleted]
2.4.9	Accounting information and standards. [Deleted]
2.5	Systems, controls and conflicts
2.5.1	A Recognised Body must ensure that the systems and controls used in the performance of its Regulatory Functions are adequate, and appropriate for the scale and nature of its business. In particular, this applies to systems and controls concerning:
(a)	the transmission of information;
(b)	the assessment, mitigation and management of risks to the performance of the Recognised Body's Regulatory Functions, including conflicts of interest;
(c)	the effecting and monitoring of transactions on the Recognised Body;
(d)	the technical operation of the Recognised Body, including contingency arrangements for disruption to its facilities;
(e)	the operation of its functions relating to the safeguards and protections to investors;
(f)	(where relevant) the safeguarding and administration of assets belonging to users of the Recognised Body's facilities; and
(g)	outsourcing.
2.5.1.Guidance	
2.5.1.Guidance.1.	General. When assessing whether its systems and controls in the performance of its Regulatory Functions are adequate and appropriate for the scale and nature of its business, a Recognised Body should have regard to its:
(a)	arrangements for managing, controlling and carrying out its Regulatory Functions, including the:
(i)	distribution of duties and responsibilities among its Key Individuals and the departments of the Recognised Body responsible for performing its Regulatory Functions;
(ii)	staffing and resources of the departments of the Recognised Body responsible for performing its Regulatory Functions;
(iii)	arrangements made to enable Key Individuals to supervise the departments for which they are responsible;
(iv)	arrangements for appointing and supervising the performance of Key Individuals (and their departments); and
(v)	arrangements by which the Governing Body is able to keep the allocation of responsibilities between, and the appointment, supervision and remuneration of, Key Individuals under review;
(b)	arrangements for the identification and management of conflicts of interest;
(c)	arrangements for internal and external audit; and
(d)	information technology systems.

2.5.1.Guidance.2.	Conflicts of interest. When assessing its systems and controls in relation to conflicts of interest, a Recognised Body should have regard to the following:
(a)	A conflict of interest arises in a situation where a Person with responsibility to act in the interests of one Person may be influenced in his action by an interest or association of his own, whether Personal or business or employment related. Conflicts of interest can arise both for the Employees of Recognised Bodies and for the members (or other Persons) who may be involved in the decision-making process, for example where they belong to committees or to the Governing Body. Conflicts of interest may also arise for the Recognised Body itself as a result of its connection with another Person.
(b)	The Regulator recognises that a Recognised Body has legitimate interests of its own and that its general business policy may properly be influenced by other Persons (such as its owners). Such a connection does not necessarily imply the existence of a conflict of interest nor is it necessary to exclude individuals closely connected with other Persons (for example, those responsible for the stewardship of the owner's interests) from all decision-making processes in a Recognised Body. However, there may be decisions, primarily regulatory decisions, from which it may be appropriate to exclude an individual in certain circumstances where an interest, position or connection of his conflicts with the interest of the Recognised Body.
(c)	A Recognised Body should make arrangements to structure itself and to allocate responsibility for decisions so that it can continue to take proper regulatory decisions notwithstanding any conflicts of interest, including the:
(i)	systems and controls intended to ensure that confidential information is only used for proper purposes;
(ii)	size and composition of the Governing Body and relevant committees;
(iii)	roles and responsibilities of Key Individuals, especially where they also have responsibilities in other organisations;
(iv)	arrangements for transferring decisions or responsibilities to alternates in individual cases; and
(v)	arrangements to ensure that individuals who may have a permanent conflict of interest in certain circumstances are excluded from the process of taking decisions (or receiving information) about matters in which that conflict of interest would be relevant.
2.5.1.Guidance.3.	Conflicts of interest. A Recognised Body should take into consideration contracts of employment, staff rules, letters of appointment for members of the Governing Body, members of relevant committees and other Key Individuals and other guidance given to individuals on handling conflicts of interest, covering:
(a)	the need for prompt disclosure of a conflict of interest to enable others, who are not affected by the conflict, to assist in deciding how it should be managed;
(b)	the circumstances in which a general disclosure of a conflict of interest, in advance of any particular instance in which that conflict of interest arises, may be sufficient;
(c)	the circumstances in which a general advance disclosure may not be adequate;
(d)	the circumstances in which it would be appropriate for a conflicted individual to withdraw from involvement in the matter concerned, without disclosing the interest; and
(e)	the circumstances in which safeguards, in addition to disclosure, would be required, such as the withdrawal of the individual from the decision-making process, or from access to relevant information.
2.5.1.Guidance.4.	Conflicts of interest. A Recognised Body should have arrangements:
(a)	for enforcing rules or other provisions applicable to staff and other Persons involved in regulatory decisions; and
(b)	to keep records of disclosures of conflicts of interest and the steps taken to handle them. 
2.5.1.Guidance.5.	Conflicts of interest. A Recognised Body should ensure that appropriate arrangements are made to:
(a)	identify conflicts between the interests of the Recognised Body, its shareholders, owners and operators and the interests of the Persons who make use of its facilities or the interests of the facilities operated by it; and
(b)	manage or disclose such conflicts so as to avoid adverse consequences for the sound functioning and operation of the facilities operated by the Recognised Body and for the Persons who make use of its facilities.
2.5.1.Guidance.6.	Conflicts of interest. A Recognised Body should establish and maintain adequate policies and procedures to ensure that its Employees do not undertake personal account transactions in Financial Instruments in a manner that creates or has the potential to create conflicts of interest.
2.5.1.Guidance.7.	Conflicts of interest. A Recognised Body should establish a code of conduct that sets out the expected standards of behaviour for its Employees, including clear procedures for addressing conflicts of interest. Such a code must be:
(a)	binding on Employees; and
(b)	to the extent appropriate and practicable, made publicly available.

2.5.1.Guidance.8.	Information transmission. When assessing its systems and controls in relation to transmission of information, a Recognised Body should ensure that information is transmitted promptly and accurately:
(a)	within the Recognised Body itself;
(b)	to its Members; and
(c)	(where appropriate) to other market participants or other relevant Persons.

2.5.1.Guidance.9.	Risk management. When assessing its systems and controls for assessing and managing risk, a Recognised Body should ensure that is able to:
(a)	identify, measure and control all the general, operational, legal and market risks wherever they arise in its activities;
(b)	allocate responsibility for risk management to Persons with appropriate knowledge and expertise; and
(c)	provide sufficient, reliable information to Key Individuals and, where relevant, the Governing Body of the Recognised Body.

2.5.1.Guidance.10.	Internal and external audit. When assessing whether it has appropriate internal and external audit arrangements in place, a Recognised Body should consider the:
(a)	size, composition and terms of reference of any audit committee of the Recognised Body's Governing Body;
(b)	frequency and scope of external audit;
(c)	provision and scope of internal audit;
(d)	staffing and resources of the Recognised Body's internal audit department;
(e)	internal audit department's access to the Recognised Body's records and other relevant information; and
(f)	position, responsibilities and reporting lines of the internal audit department and its relationship with other departments of the Recognised Body.

2.5.1.Guidance.11.	Information technology systems. When assessing the adequacy of its information technology systems, a Recognised Body should:
(a)	consider the organisation, management and resources of its information technology department;
(b)	consider its arrangements for controlling and documenting the design, development, implementation and use of information technology systems;
(c)	consider the performance, capacity and reliability of information technology systems; and
(d)	have arrangements for maintaining, recording and enforcing technical and operational standards and specifications for information technology systems, including:
(i)	procedures for the evaluation, selection and testing of information technology systems;
(ii)	procedures for problem management and system change;
(iii)	arrangements to monitor and report system performance, availability and integrity;
(iv)	arrangements (including spare capacity and access to back-up facilities) made to ensure information technology systems are resilient and not prone to failure;
(v)	arrangements made to ensure business continuity in the event that an information technology system does fail;
(vi)	arrangements made to protect information technology systems from damage, tampering, misuse or unauthorised access; and
(vii)	arrangements made to ensure the integrity of data forming part of, or being processed through, information technology systems; and
(viii)	arrangements to keep clear and complete audit trails of all uses of information technology systems and to reconcile (where appropriate) the audit trails with equivalent information held by system users and other interested parties.

2.5.1.Guidance.12.	Effecting and monitoring of transactions and operation of settlement arrangements. When assessing its systems and controls for the effecting and monitoring of transactions, and for the operation of settlement arrangements, a Recognised Body should have regard to the totality of the arrangements and processes through which its transactions are effected, cleared and settled, including:
(a)	its arrangements under which orders are received and matched, its arrangements for trade and transaction reporting, and (if relevant) its arrangements with another Person under which any rights or liabilities arising from transactions are discharged including arrangements for transmission to a settlement system or Recognised Clearing House;
(b)	if relevant, its arrangements under which instructions relating to a transaction to be cleared by another person by means of a Clearing Service are entered into its systems by the relevant person providing the Clearing Service and transmitted to the Recognised Body; and
(c)	its arrangements for monitoring and reviewing the operation of these systems and controls.

2.5.1.Guidance.13.	Safeguarding and administration of assets  When assessing its systems and controls for the safeguarding and administration of assets belonging to users of its facilities, a Recognised Body should have regard to the totality of the arrangements and processes by which it:
(a)	records the assets held and the identity of the owners of (and other persons with relevant rights over) those assets;
(b)	records any instructions given in relation to those assets;
(c)	records the carrying out of those instructions;
(d)	records any movement in those assets (or any corporate actions or other events in relation to those assets); and
(e)	reconciles its records of assets held with the records of any custodian or sub-custodian (or Person Acting as a Central Securities Depository) used to hold these assets, and with the records of beneficial or legal ownership of those assets.

2.5.2	General safeguards for investors. A Recognised Body must have rules, procedures and appropriate surveillance practices in place to ensure that its facilities are such as to afford proper protection to investors. 
2.5.2.Guidance	
When assessing whether it has appropriate rules, procedures and surveillance practices in place, a Recognised Body should consider the extent to which its rules, procedures and arrangements for monitoring and overseeing the use of its facilities:
(a)	include appropriate measures to prevent the use of its facilities for abusive or improper purposes;
(b)	provide appropriate safeguards for investors against fraud or misconduct, recklessness, negligence or incompetence by users of its facilities;
(c)	provide appropriate information to enable users of its facilities to monitor their use of the facilities;
(d)	include appropriate arrangements to enable users of its facilities to raise queries about any use of those facilities which they are reported to have made;
(e)	include appropriate arrangements to enable users of its facilities to comply with any relevant regulatory or legal requirements; and
(f)	include appropriate arrangements to reduce the risk that those facilities will be used in ways which are incompatible with relevant regulatory or legal requirements,
and in this paragraph "appropriate" should be taken to mean appropriate having regard to the nature and scale of the Recognised Body's facilities, the types of Persons who will use the facilities and the use which they will make of those facilities.

2.5.3	Promotion and maintenance of standards. A Recognised Body’s rules, practices and procedures must promote and maintain high standards of integrity and fair dealing in the carrying on of business on or through its facilities.  These rules, practices and procedures are to be consistent with the Code of Market Conduct and with any other Rules, codes or principles relating to behaviour in Regulated Activities within the Abu Dhabi Global Market Financial System. 
2.5.4	Promotion and maintenance of standards. Recognised Body must be able and willing to cooperate, by the sharing of information or otherwise, with the Regulator, with any other authority, body or Person having responsibility in the Abu Dhabi Global Market for the supervision or regulation of any Regulated Activity or other financial service, or with a Non-Abu Dhabi Global Market Regulator. Its constitution, rules and its agreements with its Members must enable it to obtain information from Members and to disclose otherwise confidential information to the Regulator and other appropriate bodies, including:
(a)	the extent to which the Recognised Body is willing to provide information about it and its activities to assist the Regulator in the exercise of its functions;
(b)	the extent to which the Recognised Body is open with the Regulator or other appropriate bodies in regulatory matters;
(c)	how diligently the Recognised Body investigates or pursues enquiries from the Regulator or other appropriate bodies; and
(d)	whether the Recognised Body participates in appropriate international fora.
2.5.4.Guidance	For the purpose of this section, "information" includes information held about large positions held by Members of a Recognised Body.

2.5.5	Performance of Regulatory Functions . A Recognised Body must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the performance of its Regulatory Functions is not adversely affected by its commercial interests.
2.5.6	Performance of Regulatory Functions . For the purposes of Rule 2.5.5, a Recognised Body must have adequate systems and controls, including policies and procedures, to ensure that the pursuit of its commercial interests (including its profitability) does not adversely impact on the performance of its Regulatory Functions.
2.5.6.Guidance	
A Recognised Body should have systems for identifying, and drawing to the attention of its Senior Management and Governing Body, situations where its commercial interests conflict, or may potentially conflict, with the proper performance of its Regulatory Functions.  This would enable the Recognised Body to take appropriate steps to ensure that such conflicts do not adversely affect the proper performance by the Recognised Body of its Regulatory Functions. In particular, the Recognised Body should ensure that adequate human, financial and other resources (both in terms of quantity and quality) are provided for risk management, regulatory supervision, compliance and other similar functions.
2.6	Operational systems and controls
2.6.1	A Recognised Body must establish a robust operational risk management framework with appropriate systems and controls to identify, monitor and manage operational risks that key participants, other Recognised Bodies, group and external service providers and utility providers might pose to itself.
2.6.2	A Recognised Body must have a business continuity plan, which is subjected to periodic review and scenario testing, that addresses events posing a significant risk of disrupting operations, including events that could cause a widespread or major disruption. The plan should:
(a)	outline objectives, policies, procedures and responsibilities to deal with internal and external business disruptions and measures to ensure timely resumption of service levels;  
(b)	include policies and procedures for event and crisis management;
(c)	incorporate the use of a secondary site;
(d)	contain appropriate emergency rules for force majeure events;
(e)	be designed to ensure that critical information technology systems can resume operations within two hours following disruptive events; 
(f)	outline business continuity procedures in respect of its Members and other users of its facilities following disruptive or force majeure events; and 
(g)	in the case of a Recognised Clearing House, be designed to enable the Recognised Clearing House to complete settlement by the end of the day of disruption, even in case of extreme circumstances.
2.6.3	A Recognised Body must have an incident management procedure in place to record, report, analyse and resolve all operational incidents.
2.6.4	A Recognised Body must have clearly defined operational reliability objectives and policies to achieve these objectives, as well as a scalable operational capacity adequate to handle increasing stress volumes, service-level objectives and historical data.
2.6.5	A Recognised Body must have a comprehensive physical and information security policy, standards, practices and controls to identify, assess and manage security threats and vulnerabilities and to protect data from loss and leakage, unauthorised access and other processing risks.
2.7	Transaction recording
2.7.1	The Recognised Body must ensure that satisfactory arrangements are made for recording transactions effected on or cleared (or to be cleared) by the Recognised Body by means of its facilities.
2.7.2	[Deleted]
2.7.2.Guidance	
When determining whether it has satisfactory arrangements for recording the transactions effected on, or cleared, or to be cleared, by means of, its facilities, a Recognised Body should have regard to:
(a)	its arrangements for creating, maintaining and safeguarding an audit trail of transactions for at least 7 years; and
(b)	the type of information recorded and the extent to which the record includes details for each transaction of:
(i)	the name of the Financial Instrument (and, if relevant, the underlying asset) and the price, quantity and date of the transaction;
(ii)	the identities and, where appropriate, the roles of the counterparties to the transaction;
(iii)	if its rules make provision for transactions to be effected, cleared or to be cleared in more than one type of facility, or under more than one part of its rules, the type of facility in which, or the part of its rules under which, the transaction was effected, cleared or to be cleared; and
(iv)	the date and manner of settlement of the transaction.
2.7.3	Where transactions are effected on a Recognised Investment Exchange and cleared through a Recognised Clearing House, the Recognised Bodies concerned may agree which information is to be recorded by each Recognised Body and need not duplicate each other's records.
2.8	Membership criteria and access
2.8.1	A Recognised Body must ensure that access to its facilities is subject to criteria designed to protect the orderly functioning of the market and the interests of investors. 
2.8.2	The Recognised Body must make transparent and non-discriminatory rules, based on objective criteria, governing access to, or membership of, its facilities. In particular, those rules must specify the obligations for users or Members of its facilities arising from:
(a)	the constitution and administration of the Recognised Body;

(a)	a restriction on any further increase in the participant’s or Member’s positions; 
(b)	a requirement to liquidate the participant’s or Member’s positions to comply with the position limit, within such time as the Recognised Investment Exchange may determine; or
(c)	such other trading conditions and restrictions as the Recognised Investment Exchange may consider necessary to ensure compliance with the relevant position limit.

(a)	categorise persons in accordance with Rule 3.3.15; and 
(b)	differentiate, to the extent possible, between positions identified as:
(i)	positions which in an objectively measurable way reduce risks directly relating to commercial activities; and

3.3.15	A Recognised Investment Exchange should, to the extent possible, classify all persons holding positions in Derivatives according to the nature of their main business, taking into account any applicable authorisation or registration, including as:
(a)	a financial intermediary including those Dealing in Investments as Agent, Dealing in Investments as Principal or Arranging Credit, or those treated as a financial intermediary under an equivalent term in a jurisdiction outside ADGM;
(b)	an investment fund, including those Managing Assets or Managing a Collective Investment Fund, or those treated similarly in a jurisdiction outside ADGM;
(c)	another Financial Institution, including insurance management; or

The aggregate number of orders and the Financial Instruments those orders represent, at each price level, for at least the five best bid and offer price levels.
Quote-driven trading system	A system where transactions are concluded on the basis of firm quotes that are continuously made available to participants, which requires the market makers to maintain quotes in a size that balances the needs of Members and participants to deal in a commercial size and the risk to which the market maker exposes itself.	The best bid and offer by price of each market maker in that Financial Instrument, together with the volumes attaching to those prices.
The quotes made public shall be those that represent binding commitments to buy and sell the Financial Instruments and which indicate the price and volume of Financial Instruments in which the registered market makers are prepared to buy or sell.  

In exceptional market conditions, however, indicative or one-way prices may be allowed for a limited time.
Periodic auction trading system	A system that matches orders on the basis of a periodic auction and a trading algorithm operated without human intervention.	The price that would best satisfy the system’s trading algorithm and the volume that would potentially be executable at that price by participants in the system.
Trading system not covered by first three trading systems	A hybrid system falling into two or more of the first three trading systems or a system where the price determination process is of a different nature than that applicable to the types of system covered by the first three trading systems.	Adequate information as to the price level of orders or quotes for each Financial Instrument, and of the trading interest in that Financial Instrument.
In particular, the five best bid and offer price levels and/or two way quotes of each market maker in the Financial Instrument, if the characteristics of the price discovery mechanism so permit.

(b)	systems that formalise negotiated transactions, which are:
(i)	made at, or within, the current volume weighted spread reflected on the order book or the quotes of the market makers, subject to a volume cap to be determined by the Regulator to ensure that the use of this waiver does not unduly harm price formation;
(ii)	where the Financial Instrument does not fall within the meaning of a liquid market, and are dealt within a percentage of a suitable reference price, being a percentage and a reference price set in advance by the Recognised Investment Exchange; or

When assessing whether Units are capable of being traded in a fair, orderly and efficient manner for the purposes of Rule 3.9.1, a Recognised Investment Exchange shall take the following aspects into account:
(a)	For an open-ended Collective Investment Fund:
(i)	the distribution of those Units to the public;
(ii)	whether there are appropriate market-making arrangements, or whether the Fund Manager provides appropriate alternative arrangements for investors to redeem the Units; and
(iii)	whether the value of the units is made sufficiently transparent to investors by means of the periodic publication of the net asset value.
(b)	For a closed-ended Investment Fund:
(i)	the distribution of those Units to the public; and
(ii)	whether the value of the Units is made sufficiently transparent to investors, either by publication of information on the Fund's investment strategy or by the periodic publication of a net asset value.
3.9.4	Derivatives
When admitting to trading a Financial Instrument that is a Derivative, a Recognised Investment Exchange shall verify that the following conditions are satisfied:
(a)	the terms of the contract establishing the Derivative must be clear and unambiguous, and enable a correlation between the price of the Derivative and the price or other value measure of the underlying;
(b)	the price or other value measure of the underlying must be reliable and publicly available or ascertainable; or the contract establishing that instrument must be likely to provide a means of disclosing to the market, or enabling the market to assess, the price or other value measure of the underlying, where the price or value measure is not otherwise publicly available;
(c)	sufficient information of a kind needed to value the Derivative must be publicly available or ascertainable;
(d)	the arrangements for determining the settlement price of the contract must be such that the price properly reflects the price or other value measure of the underlying or reference;

3.9.5	[Deleted]
3.10	Default Rules 
3.10.1	A Recognised Investment Exchange must have legally enforceable Default Rules which, in the event of a Member of the Recognised Investment Exchange being or appearing to be unable to meet his obligations in respect of one or more Market Contracts, enable it to suspend or terminate such Member's membership and cooperate by sharing information with its Recognised Clearing House.
3.10.2	The Recognised Investment Exchange must issue a public notice on its website in respect of any Member whose membership is so suspended or terminated.
3.10.3	The Recognised Investment Exchange must be able and willing to cooperate, by the sharing of information and otherwise, with the Regulator, any Relevant Office Holder and any other authority or body having responsibility for any matter arising out of, or connected with, the default of a Member of the Recognised Investment Exchange or any designated non-Member or the default of a Recognised Clearing House or another Recognised Investment Exchange.
3.11	Use of Price Reporting Agencies
3.11.1	When admitting to trading a Financial Instrument that references an underlying benchmark or index provided by a Price Reporting Agency, a Recognised Investment Exchange must undertake appropriate due diligence to ensure that the Price Reporting Agency meets the requirements in Rule 3.11.2.

4	RULES APPLICABLE TO RECOGNISED CLEARING HOUSES
4.1	Introduction
4.1.1	This chapter contains additional Recognition Requirements applicable to Recognised Clearing Houses. 
4.1.2	The Rules in this chapter are intended to be consistent with the CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures. All Recognised Clearing Houses should comply with such principles. 
4.1.3	Requirements applicable to a Recognised Clearing House that is providing Central Counterparty Services are set out in the following Rules:
(a)	Rule 4.6 (Stress testing of capital);
(b)	Rule 4.7.14 to 4.7.21 (Credit risk);
(c)	Rule 4.10 (Collateral and margin); and
(d)	Rule 4.12 (Segregation and portability).  
4.1.4	A Recognised Clearing House may also act as a Trade Repository if its Recognition Order includes a stipulation permitting it to do so. Acting as a Trade Repository will result in it being subject to the additional conduct requirements in Appendix 2 of GEN.
4.1.5	A Recognised Clearing House may also conduct activities in relation to Accepted Virtual Assets if its Recognition Order includes a stipulation permitting it to do so.  If it does include such a stipulation, the additional rules on Virtual Assets in COBS chapter 17 will apply to that function, but that function only.
4.1.6	A Recognised Clearing House may also conduct activities in relation to Accepted Spot Commodities if its Recognition Order includes a stipulation permitting it to do so.  If it does include such a stipulation, the additional rules on Spot Commodities in COBS chapter 22 will apply to that function, but that function only.
4.2	Capital requirements
4.2.1	A Recognised Clearing House shall hold capital more than or equal to the sum of capital calculated in respect of the following risks.
(a)	Winding down or restructuring activities. Six months' gross operational expenses.
(b)	Operational risks. A Recognised Clearing House shall calculate its capital requirement for operational risks using either the Basic Indicator Approach or, with prior authorisation from the Regulator, the Standardised Approach or the Alternative Standardised Approach, both as provided specifically in Appendix 7.3 and generally in Appendix 7 of PRU. 
(c)	Credit, counterparty credit and market risks. A Recognised Clearing House shall calculate its capital requirements as the sum of 10% of its risk-weighted exposure amounts for credit and counterparty credit risk and its capital requirements for market risk calculated in accordance with Appendix 6 of PRU, subject to the following.
(i)	For the calculation of the risk-weighted exposure amounts for credit risk and counterparty credit risk, a Recognised Clearing House shall apply the Credit Risk Capital Requirement (CRCOM) method in section 4.8 of PRU.
(ii)	Where a Recognised Clearing House does not use its own resources, the Recognised Clearing House shall apply a risk weight of 250% to its exposure stemming from any contributions to the default fund of another Clearing house and a risk weight of 2% to any trade exposures with another Clearing house.
(d)	Business risk. A Recognised Clearing House shall submit to the Regulator for approval its own estimate of the capital necessary to cover losses resulting from business risk based on reasonably foreseeable adverse scenarios relevant to its business model. The capital requirement for business risk shall be equal to the approved estimate and shall be subject to a minimum amount of 25% of its annual gross operational expenses. 
4.2.2	For the purposes of Rule ‎4.2.1, Recognised Clearing Houses shall use the most recent audited information from their annual financial statement and operational expenses shall be considered in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 
4.2.3	A Recognised Clearing House shall have procedures in place to identify all sources of risks that may impact its on-going functions and shall consider the likelihood of potential adverse effects on its revenues or expenses and its level of capital.
4.2.4	If the amount of capital held by a Recognised Clearing House is lower than 110% of the capital requirements or lower than 110% of USD 9.5 million (the "notification threshold"), the Recognised Clearing House shall immediately notify the Regulator in writing of the information set out in Rule ‎5.4.1 and keep it updated at least weekly, until the amount of capital held by the Recognised Clearing House returns above the notification threshold.
4.3	Clearing and settlement
4.3.1	A Recognised Clearing House must be able to demonstrate compliance with internationally accepted standards for financial market infrastructures to the satisfaction of the Regulator.
4.3.2	A Recognised Clearing House must ensure that its Clearing Services include satisfactory arrangements for securing the timely discharge (whether by performance, compromise or otherwise) of the rights and liabilities of the parties to transactions for which it provides such services.
4.3.2.Guidance	
When determining whether it has satisfactory arrangements in place for securing the timely discharge of the rights and liabilities of the parties to transactions, a Recognised Clearing House should have regard to its:
(a)	Clearing Rules and practices relating to Clearing and settlement including its arrangements with another Person for the provision of Clearing and settlement services;
(b)	arrangements for matching trades and ensuring that the parties are in agreement about trade details;
(c)	where relevant, arrangements for making deliveries and payments, in all relevant jurisdictions;
(d)	procedures to detect and deal with the failure of a Member to settle in accordance with its Clearing Rules;
(e)	arrangements for taking action to settle a trade if a Member does not settle in accordance with its Clearing Rules;
(f)	arrangements for monitoring its Members' settlement performance; and
(g)	(where appropriate) Default Rules and default procedures.
4.3.3	A Recognised Clearing House will not be regarded as failing to comply with the Recognition Requirement merely because it is unable to arrange for a specific transaction to be settled.
4.4	Admission of Financial Instruments to Clearing – investment criteria
4.4.1	A Recognised Clearing House must have clear and objective criteria ("Investment Criteria") included in its Clearing Rules according to which Financial Instruments can be cleared and settled on its facilities. The Investment Criteria must include the requirements in Rule ‎4.4.2(a) and ‎(b) below as relevant.
4.4.2	A Recognised Clearing House must ensure that Financial Instruments are cleared on its facilities only if:
(a)	in the case of Securities, such Securities are either:
(i)	admitted to the Official List of Securities; or
(ii)	admitted to trading on a Recognised Investment Exchange, Remote Investment Exchange, or a market in a jurisdiction acceptable to the Regulator; and
(b)	in the case of Derivative contracts, are traded on a Recognised Investment Exchange, Remote Investment Exchange, or a market in a jurisdiction acceptable to the Regulator, having regard to:
(i)	the degree of standardisation of the contractual terms and operational processes of the Derivative contract;
(ii)	the volume and liquidity of the Derivative contract; and
(iii)	the availability of fair, reliable and generally accepted pricing information in the Derivative contract.
4.5	Default Rules
4.5.1	[Deleted]
4.5.2	[Deleted]
4.5.3	A Recognised Clearing House which provides central counterparty, clearing or settlement facilities must make transparent and non-discriminatory Clearing Rules based on objective criteria, governing access to those facilities. A Recognised Body may refuse access to these facilities on legitimate commercial grounds. 
4.5.4	A Recognised Clearing House must have legally enforceable Default Rules which, in the event of a Member (including if a Member is another Recognised Clearing House or a Recognised Investment Exchange) being, or appearing to be, unable to meet his obligations in respect of one or more Market Contracts, enable action to be taken in respect of unsettled Market Contracts to which the Member is a party, where appropriate to the risks faced by it, including:
(a)	effecting any transfers and close-outs of a defaulting Members’ or participant's assets or proprietary or Client positions (as applicable) to the Recognised Clearing House, a non-defaulting Member or participant, and/or to a receiver, third party or bridge financial company; 
(b)	the auction of any position or asset of the defaulting Member or participant in the market; 
(c)	the application the proceeds of liquidation, and other funds and assets of the defaulting Member or participant; and/or
(d)	the use of a default contribution fund mechanism whereby defaulting and non defaulting Members’ or participants’ pre funded contributions to the default contribution fund are applied to cover the obligation.
4.5.5	The Default Rules shall clearly define and specify:
(a)	circumstances which constitute a default, addressing both financial and operational default, and how the different types of default may be treated by the Recognised Clearing House;
(b)	the method for identifying a default, including any automatic or discretionary default scenarios, and how the discretion is exercised in any discretionary default scenarios;
(c)	potential changes to the normal settlement practices in a default scenario;
(d)	the management of transactions at different stages of processing;
(e)	the expected treatment of proprietary and Client transactions and accounts;
(f)	the probable sequencing of actions that the Recognised Clearing House may take;
(g)	the roles, obligations and responsibilities of various parties, including the Recognised Clearing House, the defaulting Member and non-defaulting participants;
(h)	how to address the defaulting Member's obligations to Clients; 
(i)	how to address the allocation of any credit losses it may face as a result of any individual or combined default among its participants with respect to their obligations to the Recognised Clearing House and how stress events are dealt with; 
(j)	any other mechanisms that may be activated to contain the impact of a default, including:
(i)	a default contribution fund, whereby defaulting and non-defaulting Members or participants' pre funded contributions to the default contribution fund are applied to cover the losses or shortfall arising on a default on the basis of a predetermined order of priority; and
(ii)	a resolution regime of the defaulting participant, involving "porting" or transferring the open positions and margin related to Client transactions to a non defaulting participant, receiver, third party or bridge financial company;
(k)	for all remaining rights and liabilities of the defaulter under or in respect of unsettled Market Contracts to be discharged and for there to be paid by or to the defaulter such sum of money (if any) as may be determined in accordance with the Default Rules, by offsetting all relevant rights, assets and liabilities on the relevant account;
(l)	for the certification by or on behalf of the Recognised Clearing House of the sum finally payable or, as the case may be, of the fact that no sum is payable, separately for each account of the defaulter;
(m)	the Recognised Clearing House's segregation and portability arrangements, including the method for determining the value at which Client positions will be transferred; and
(n)	provisions ensuring that losses that arise as a result of the default of a Member of the Recognised Clearing House or threaten the Recognised Clearing House's solvency are allocated with a view to ensuring that the Recognised Clearing House can continue to provide the services and carry on the activities specified in its Recognition Order.
4.5.6	Default Rules should be reviewed and tested at least annually or following material changes to the rules and procedures to ensure that they are practical and effective.
4.5.7	A Recognised Clearing House must have adequate compliance procedures in place to ensure that:
(a)	its Clearing Rules and Default Rules are monitored and enforced;
(b)	any complaints relating to its operations or regarding Members and other participants on its facilities are promptly investigated;
(c)	where appropriate, disciplinary action resulting in financial and other types of penalties can be taken;
(d)	appeal procedures are in place; and
(e)	referrals can be made to the Regulator in appropriate circumstances.
4.5.8	The Default Rules may make the same or similar provision, in relation to Designated Non-Members that have been designated as such in accordance with the procedures mentioned in Rule 4.5.9, as in relation to Members of the Recognised Clearing House.
4.5.9	If such provision is made as allowed under Rule 4.5.8, the Recognised Clearing House must have adequate procedures for:
(a)	designating the Persons, or descriptions of person, in respect of whom action may be taken;
(b)	keeping under review the question which Persons or descriptions of person should be or remain so designated; and
(c)	withdrawing such designation.
4.5.10	The procedures in Rule 4.5.9 must be designed to ensure that:
(a)	a Person is not, or does not remain, designated if failure by him to meet his obligations in respect of one or more Market Contracts would adversely affect the operation of the market; and
(b)	a description of persons is not, or does not remain, designated if failure by a Person of that description to meet his obligations in respect of one or more Market Contracts would affect operation of the market.
4.5.11	The Recognised Body must have adequate arrangements:
(a)	for bringing a designation or withdrawal of designation to the attention of the Person or description of persons concerned; and
(b)	where a description of Persons is designated, or the designation of a description of persons is withdrawn, for ascertaining which Persons fall within that description.
4.6	Stress testing of capital
4.6.1	A Recognised Clearing House should adopt comprehensive and stringent measures to ensure that it has adequate total financial resources to effectively manage its credit risk and exposures. 
4.6.2	A Recognised Clearing House should determine the amount of the total financial resources available to it and regularly test the sufficiency of such amount, particularly in the event of a default or multiple defaults in extreme but plausible market conditions through rigorous stress testing.
4.6.3	In conducting stress testing, a Recognised Clearing House should consider the effect of a wide range of relevant stress scenarios in terms of both defaulters' positions and possible price changes in liquidation periods. Scenarios should include relevant peak historic price volatilities, shifts in other market factors such as price determinants and yield curves, multiple defaults over various time horizons, simultaneous pressures in funding and asset markets, and a spectrum of forward-looking stress scenarios in a variety of extreme but plausible market conditions.
4.6.4	A Recognised Clearing House which is involved in activities with a more-complex risk profile, or is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions, should maintain additional financial resources to cover a wide range of potential stress scenarios. These should include the default of the two of its market counterparties (including their affiliates) that would potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposure for the Recognised Clearing House in extreme but plausible market conditions. In all other cases, a Recognised Clearing House should maintain additional financial resources sufficient to cover a wide range of potential stress scenarios, which include the default of the market counterparty (including its affiliates) that would potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposure for the Recognised Clearing House in extreme but plausible market conditions.

4.7	Risk management

4.7.1	Risk management framework. A Recognised Clearing House must have a comprehensive risk management framework (i.e. detailed policies, procedures and systems) capable of managing systemic, legal, credit, liquidity, operational and other risks to which it is exposed.
4.7.2	Risk management framework. The risk management framework in Rule ‎4.7.1 must:
(a)	encompass a regular review of material risks to which the Recognised Clearing House is exposed and the risks posed to other market participants resulting from its operations; and
(b)	be subject to periodic review as appropriate to ensure that it is effective and operating as intended.
4.7.3	Risk management framework. The risk management framework should identify scenarios that may potentially prevent a Recognised Clearing House from being able to provide its critical operations and services as a going concern and assess the effectiveness of a full range of options for recovery or orderly wind down.
4.7.4	Risk management framework. A Recognised Clearing House should prepare appropriate plans for resumption of its operations in such scenarios and, where it is not possible to do so, for an orderly wind-down of the operations of the Recognised Clearing House premised on the results of such assessments. Such procedures should also include appropriate early notification to the Regulator and other regulators as appropriate. 
4.7.5	Risk management framework. A Recognised Clearing House should, to the extent possible, provide incentives to Members and other market participants to manage and contain the risks they pose to the orderly and efficient operations of the Recognised Clearing House. Those may include financial penalties for Members and other participants that fail to settle Investments in a timely manner or to repay intra-day credit by the end of the Business Day.

4.7.6	Operational risk. A Recognised Clearing House shall have in place a well-documented assessment and management system for operational risk with clear responsibilities assigned for this system. It shall identify its exposures to operational risk and track relevant operational risk data, including material loss data. This system shall be subject to regular review carried out by an independent party possessing the necessary knowledge to carry out such review. 
4.7.7	An operational risk assessment system shall be closely integrated into the risk management processes of the Recognised Clearing House. Its output shall be an integral part of the process of monitoring and controlling the operational risk profile. 
4.7.8	Operational risk. A Recognised Clearing House shall implement a system of reporting to Senior Management that provides operational risk reports to Regulatory Functions within the institutions. A Recognised Clearing House shall have in place procedures for taking appropriate action according to the information within the reports to management.

4.7.9	Legal risk. A Recognised Clearing House must have a well-founded, clear, transparent, and enforceable legal basis for each material aspect of its activities in all relevant jurisdictions.
4.7.10	Legal risk. A Recognised Clearing House must have adequate Clearing Rules and procedures, including contractual arrangements, which are legally enforceable.
4.7.11	Legal risk. A Recognised Clearing House that operates in multiple jurisdictions must:
(a)	identify and mitigate the risks arising from doing business in the relevant jurisdictions, including those arising from conflicting laws applicable in such jurisdictions; and
(b)	ensure the arrangements referred to in Rule ‎4.7.10 provide a high degree of certainty that actions taken by the Recognised Clearing House under its Clearing Rules and procedures will not be reversed, stayed or rendered void.
4.7.12	Legal risk. [Deleted]
4.7.12.Guidance	Legal risk.
4.7.12.Guidance.1.	A Recognised Clearing House may be conducting its activities in multiple jurisdictions in circumstances such as:
(a)	where it operates through linked Recognised Clearing Houses in or outside of the Abu Dhabi Global Market, or clearing houses, securities settlement systems, being systems that enable Financial Instruments to be transferred and settled by book entry, or central securities depositories outside of the Abu Dhabi Global Market;  
(b)	where its Members and other participants are incorporated, located, or otherwise conducting business in jurisdictions outside the Abu Dhabi Global Market; or
(c)	where any collateral provided is located or held in a jurisdiction outside the Abu Dhabi Global Market.
4.7.13	[Deleted]
4.7.12.Guidance.2.	A Recognised Clearing House should be able to demonstrate to the Regulator that the legal basis on which it operates, including in multiple jurisdictions, is well founded. This would include:
(a)	well defined rights and obligations of the Recognised Clearing House, its Members and other users, including its service providers such as custodians and settlement banks, or would provide a mechanism by which such rights and obligations can be ascertained. This would enable the Recognised Clearing House to identify and address risks that arise from its operations involving such parties;
(b)	adequately addressing legal risks faced by a Recognised Clearing House, particularly where it operates in multiple jurisdictions including a situation where an unexpected application of a law or regulation may render a contract between itself and counterparty void or unenforceable, thereby leading to a loss; and
(c)	obtaining independent legal opinions as appropriate to its activities in order to form clear views about the legally binding nature of its contractual arrangements in the relevant jurisdictions. Such legal opinions should, to the extent practicable, confirm the enforceability of the Clearing Rules and procedures of the Recognised Clearing House in the relevant jurisdictions and be made available to the Regulator upon request.

4.7.14	Credit risk. A Recognised Clearing House must establish and implement a robust process to manage:
(a)	its current and potential future credit and market risk exposures to market counterparties, including Members and other participants on its facilities; and
(b)	credit risks arising from its payment, Clearing, and settlement processes.
4.7.15	Credit risk. The process referred to in Rule ‎4.7.14 must:
(a)	enable a Recognised Clearing House to effectively measure, monitor, and manage its risks and exposures effectively;
(b)	enable a Recognised Clearing House to identify sources of credit risk and routinely measure and monitor its credit exposures; and
(c)	use appropriate risk management tools or margin and other prefunded financial resources to control the identified credit risks.
4.7.16	For the purposes of Rule ‎4.7.14, a Recognised Clearing House must, on a regular basis as appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity of its operations:
(a)	perform stress tests using models containing standards and predetermined parameters and assumptions; and
(b)	carry out comprehensive and thorough analysis of stress testing models, scenarios, and underlying parameters and assumptions used to ensure that they are appropriate for determining the required level of default protection in light of current and evolving market conditions.
4.7.17	A Recognised Clearing House must:
(a)	undertake the analysis referred to in Rule ‎4.7.16(b) at least on a two-monthly basis, unless more frequent analysis is warranted because the Investments cleared or markets served display high volatility, become less liquid, or when the size or concentration of positions held by its participants increase significantly; 
(b)	consider carrying out daily stress testing to measure and monitor its risk exposures, especially if its operations are complex or widely spread over multiple jurisdictions; and
(c)	perform a full validation of its risk-management models at least annually.
4.7.18	A Recognised Clearing House must establish explicit Clearing Rules, Default Rules and procedures that address fully any credit losses it may face as a result of any individual or combined default among its Members and other participants with respect to any of their obligations to the Recognised Clearing House. Such Clearing Rules, Default Rules and procedures should:
(a)	address how any potentially uncovered credit losses would be allocated, including the repayment of any funds the Recognised Clearing House may borrow from its liquidity providers; and
(b)	indicate the Recognised Clearing House's process to replenish any financial resources that it may employ during a stress event, so that it can continue to operate in a safe and sound manner.
4.7.19	A Recognised Clearing House must document its supporting rationale for, and have appropriate governance arrangements relating to, the amount of total financial resources it maintains. 

4.7.20	A Recognised Clearing House must have clear procedures to report the results of its stress tests to its Governing Body and Senior Management as appropriate.
4.7.21	A Recognised Clearing House must use the results of its stress tests to evaluate the adequacy of its total financial resources and make any adjustments as appropriate.

4.7.22	Liquidity risk. A Recognised Clearing House must:
(a)	determine the amount of its minimum liquid resources;
(b)	maintain sufficient liquid resources to be able to effect same-day, intra-day or multi-day settlement, as applicable, of its payment obligations with a high degree of confidence under a wide range of potential stress scenarios;
(c)	ensure that all resources held for the purposes of meeting its minimum liquid resource requirement are available when needed;
(d)	have a well-documented rationale to support the amount and form of total liquid resources it maintains for the purposes of ‎(b) and ‎(c); and
(e)	have appropriate arrangements in order to be able to maintain, on an on-going basis, such amount and form of its total liquid resources.
4.7.23	Liquidity risk. A Recognised Clearing House must have a robust framework for managing its liquidity risks. Such a framework must enable it to manage liquidity risks arising from its Members and other participants on its facilities, and any other involved parties, such as settlement banks, custodian banks, liquidity providers ("Members and other involved parties"). For that purpose, the framework must, at a minimum, include:
(a)	Clearing Rules, Default Rules and procedures that:
(i)	enable the Recognised Clearing House to meet its payment obligations on time following any individual or combined default of its Members and other involved parties; 
(ii)	address unforeseen and potentially uncovered liquidity shortfalls to avoid unwinding, revoking, or delaying the settlement of its payment obligations arising under the same-day, intra-day or multiday settlement obligations, as applicable; and
(iii)	indicate any liquidity resources the Recognised Clearing House may deploy, in the event of default by a Member or other involved parties, during a stress event to replenish the available liquid resources and the associated process, so that it can continue to operate in a safe and sound manner;
(b)	effective operational and analytical tools to identify, measure and monitor its settlement and funding flows on an on-going and timely basis; and
(c)	rigorous due diligence procedures relating to its liquidity providers to obtain a high degree of confidence that each provider (whether the provider is a Member or other participant using its facilities or an external party) has:
(i)	sufficient information to assess, understand and manage its own liquidity risks; and
(ii)	the capacity to perform as required under their commitment.
4.7.24	Liquidity risk. The framework referred to in Rule ‎4.7.23 must enable the Recognised Clearing House to effectively measure, monitor, and manage its liquidity risk.
4.7.25	Liquidity risk. To the extent that the Clearing Rules addressing liquidity risk referred to in Rule ‎4.7.23 also address credit risks, the same Clearing Rules, after adjustment as appropriate, can be used for both purposes.
4.7.26	Liquidity risk. A Recognised Clearing House must regularly:
(a)	review the adequacy of the amount of its minimum liquid resources as determined in accordance with Rule ‎4.7.22;
(b)	test the sufficiency of its liquid resources maintained to meet the relevant amount through rigorous stress testing; and
(c)	test its procedures for accessing its liquid resources at a liquidity provider.
4.7.27	Liquidity risk.[Deleted]
4.7.27.Guidance	Liquidity risk.
4.7.27.Guidance.1.	In conducting its stress testing, a Recognised Clearing House should consider:
(a)	a wide range of relevant scenarios including relevant peak historic price volatilities, shifts in other market factors such as price determinants and yield curves, multiple defaults over various time horizons, simultaneous pressures in funding and asset markets, and a spectrum of forward-looking stress scenarios in a variety of extreme but plausible market conditions;
(b)	the design and operation of the Recognised Clearing House;
(c)	all entities that may pose material liquidity risks to the Recognised Clearing House (such as settlement banks, custodian banks, liquidity providers, and other involved entities); and
(d)	where appropriate, for price fluctuations during a multi-day period.
4.7.28	[Deleted]
4.7.27.Guidance.2.	For the purposes of meeting the minimum liquid resource requirement referred to in Rule ‎4.7.22, a Recognised Clearing House's qualifying liquid assets/resources may include:
(a)	cash held in appropriate currencies at a central bank in its or other relevant jurisdiction, or at creditworthy commercial banks;
(b)	committed lines of credit;
(c)	committed foreign exchange swaps;
(d)	committed repos; and
(e)	highly marketable collateral held in custody and Investments that are readily available and convertible into cash with prearranged and highly reliable funding arrangements, even in extreme but plausible market conditions.
4.7.29	A Recognised Clearing House's access to a routine line of credit made available by a central bank in its or other relevant jurisdiction, to the extent that the Recognised Clearing House has collateral that is eligible for pledging to (or for conducting other appropriate forms of transactions with) the relevant central bank must comply with the following to count as liquid assets/resources:
(a)	a Recognised Clearing House must take account of what collateral is typically accepted by the relevant central bank as such assets may be more likely to be liquid in stressed circumstances, even if the Recognised Clearing House does not have access to a routine line of credit made available by a central bank; and
(b)	a Recognised Clearing House should not assume the availability of emergency central bank credit as a part of its liquidity plan.
4.7.30	[Deleted]
4.7.30.Guidance	
4.7.30.Guidance.1.	A Recognised Clearing House may supplement its qualifying liquid resources with other forms of liquid resources; and such liquid resources should be in the form of assets that are likely to be saleable, or acceptable as collateral, for lines of credit, swaps, or repos on an ad hoc basis following a default, even if this cannot be reliably prearranged or guaranteed in extreme market conditions.
4.7.31	[Deleted]
4.7.30.Guidance.2.	Where a Recognised Clearing House has access to a central bank lines of credit or accounts, payment services, or securities services, it should use those services as far as practicable, as such use is likely to enhance its ability to manage liquidity risk more effectively.
4.7.32	A Recognised Clearing House must have clear procedures to report the results of its stress tests undertaken for the purposes of this Rule to its Governing Body and Senior Management as appropriate. 
4.7.33	A Recognised Clearing House must use the results of stress testing to evaluate the adequacy of its liquidity risk-management framework and make any appropriate adjustments as needed.
4.7.34	A Recognised Clearing House must record the results of such stress testing and the rationale for any adjustments made to the amount and form of total liquid resources it maintains.

4.7.35	Custody and investment risk. A Recognised Clearing House must have effective means to address risks relating to the custody of its:
(a)	own assets (or banking of its cash), in accordance with Rule ‎4.7.36; and
(b)	Members and other participants' assets in accordance with Rule ‎4.7.37.
4.7.36	Custody and investment risk. For the purposes of Rules ‎4.7.35(a) and ‎4.7.35(b), a Recognised Clearing House must:
(a)	hold its own deposits and custody assets only with entities which have been granted Financial Services Permission by the Regulator or in banks or credit institutions regulated by a non-Abu Dhabi Global Market Financial Services Regulator considered by the Regulator to be equivalent for such purposes;
(b)	be able to have prompt access to its deposits and custody assets when required; and
(c)	regularly evaluate and understand its exposures to entities which hold its assets, including the monitoring of the overall risk exposure to an individual banker or custodian remains within acceptable concentration limits and of the bank or custodian's financial condition on an on-going basis.
4.7.37	Custody and investment risk. For the purposes of investing its own or its participants' deposits and custody assets, a Recognised Clearing House must ensure that:
(a)	it has an investment strategy which is consistent with its overall risk-management strategy and is fully disclosed to its Members and other participants using its facilities; and
(b)	its Investments comprise instruments with minimal credit, market, and liquidity risks. For this purpose, the Investments may be secured by, or be claims on, high-quality obligors, or the arrangements allow for quick liquidation with little, if any, adverse price effect, or there is no Investments in obligors affiliated with or securities issued by the participant.
4.8	Money settlement
4.8.1	Where a Recognised Clearing House conducts its money settlements using commercial bank money, it must adopt appropriate measures to minimise and strictly control the credit and liquidity risk arising from such use.
4.8.2	For the purposes of Rule ‎4.8.1, a Recognised Clearing House must:
(a)	conduct its money settlements using only such settlement assets with little or no credit or liquidity risk;
(b)	monitor, manage, and limit its credit and liquidity risks arising from commercial settlement banks. In particular, it must establish and monitor adherence to strict criteria for the use of settlement banks, which take into account, among other things, the regulation and supervision, creditworthiness, capitalisation, access to liquidity, and operational reliability of the relevant settlement banks; and
(c)	monitor and manage the concentration of credit and liquidity exposures to its commercial settlement banks, including, to the extent such banks are also Members ensure that its legal agreements with such settlement banks, at a minimum:
(i)	specify clearly when transfers on the books of individual settlement banks are expected to occur and when they are final; 
(ii)	ensure that funds received are transferable as soon as possible, if not intra-day, at least by the end of the day to enable it and its Members and other participants on its facilities to manage their credit and liquidity risks; and
(iii)	not permit such banks to combine or offset any right or liability they or their affiliates may have in their capacity as a Clearing Member.
4.8.3	If a Recognised Clearing House does not conduct its money settlement on commercial bank money but on its own books, it should minimise and strictly control its credit and liquidity risks as appropriate.
4.9	Physical delivery
4.9.1	A Recognised Clearing House incurring obligations that require physical delivery of physical instruments or commodities must:
(a)	provide adequate information to its Members and other participants using its facilities relating to its obligations with respect to physical delivery of the physical instruments or commodities. Such information must also be made publicly available;
(b)	identify, monitor, and manage the risks associated with such physical deliveries; and
(c)	identify, monitor, and manage the risks and costs associated with the storage and delivery.
4.9.2	A Recognised Clearing House must have adequate arrangements, including service agreements, which enable it to meet its physical delivery obligations.
4.9.2.Guidance	
4.9.2.Guidance.1.	Where a Recognised Clearing House matches participants that have delivery and receipt obligations, the Recognised Clearing House would not need to be involved with the physical storage and delivery process but it should monitor the participants' performance and to the extent practicable, ensure the participants have the necessary systems and resources to be able to fulfil their physical delivery obligations.
4.9.2.Guidance.2.	The legal obligations for delivery should be clearly expressed in the Clearing Rules, Default Rules, and any related agreements, including provisions to specify, for instance:
(a)	whether the receiving participant should seek compensation from the Recognised Clearing House or the delivering participant in the event of a loss; and
(b)	if the Recognised Clearing House holds margin on the matched participants, such margin will only be released until the Recognised Clearing House confirms that both participants have fulfilled their obligations.
4.10	Collateral and margin
4.10.1	A Recognised Clearing House must call and receive collateral to manage its risks arising in the course of or for the purposes of its payment, Clearing, and settlement processes. It must, in the normal course of business, only accept collateral with low credit, liquidity, and market risks.
4.10.2	[Deleted]
4.10.2.Guidance	
In some instances, certain types of assets which are not considered to have low credit, liquidity and market risks may be acceptable for credit purposes if the Recognised Clearing House sets and enforces appropriately conservative haircuts and concentration limits and appropriate collateral risk management procedures are put in place by the Recognised Clearing House. A Recognised Clearing House may, in some circumstances, accept the deliverable of a contract as collateral against the contract for exchange.
4.10.3	A Recognised Clearing House must, for the purposes of meeting the requirement in Rule ‎4.10.1, establish and implement a collateral management system that is well designed and operationally flexible to enable ongoing monitoring and management of collateral. A Recognised Clearing House must also ensure that it is confident of the collateral's value in the event of liquidation and its capacity to use that collateral quickly, especially in stressed market conditions. Such a system must, at a minimum:
(a)	allow for timely calculation and execution of margin calls, accurate daily reporting of initial and variation margin, and the management of any disputes;
(b)	track the extent of reuse of collateral by the Recognised Clearing House (both cash and non-cash) and the rights of the Recognised Clearing House to the collateral;
(c)	accommodate timely deposit, withdrawal, substitution and liquidation of collateral; 
(d)	regularly adjust its requirements for acceptable collateral in accordance with changes in underlying risks;
(e)	establish prudent valuation practices, including daily marking to market of the Recognised Clearing House's collateral;
(f)	develop haircuts that are regularly tested, independently validated at least annually and take into account stressed market conditions;
(g)	reduce the need for procyclical adjustments, by establishing, to the extent practicable and prudent, stable and conservative haircuts that are calibrated to include periods of stressed market conditions;
(h)	establish concentration limits which are periodically reviewed by the Recognised Clearing House to determine their adequacy or imposing concentration charges to avoid concentrated holdings of certain assets where that would significantly impair the ability to liquidate such assets quickly without significant adverse price effects; and
(i)	mitigate, if it accepts collateral held in another jurisdiction or governed by non-Abu Dhabi Global Market law, the risks and exposures associated with such use, including considering foreign exchange risk, legal and operational challenges such as differences in operating hours of foreign custodians and central securities depositories and conflicts of law risks. Such measures must ensure that the collateral can be used in a timely manner and should identify and address any significant liquidity effects and legal risks.
4.10.4	If a Recognised Clearing House plans to use assets held as collateral to secure liquidity facilities in the event of a participant default, the Recognised Clearing House must:
(a)	consider, in determining acceptable collateral, what will be acceptable as security to lenders offering liquidity facilities.
(b)	measure and monitor the correlation between a counterpart's creditworthiness and the collateral posted; and
(c)	take measures to mitigate risks, that the collateral would likely lose value in the event that the participant providing the collateral defaults.
4.10.5	The Clearing Rules of the Recognised Clearing House must set out:
(a)	collateral and margin requirements and collateral management process, and specify when a Recognised Clearing House may reuse or invest its participants' collateral and the process for returning that collateral to participants; and
(b)	in the event of a default, that margin provided by the defaulter for any Client account is not to be applied to meet a shortfall its own proprietary account.
4.10.6	A Recognised Clearing House must, for the purposes of managing its exposures and risk and the requirements in Rules ‎4.10.7 and ‎4.10.8:
(a)	mark participant positions to market and collect variation margin at least daily to limit the build-up of current exposures;
(b)	have necessary authority and operational capacity to make intra day margin calls and payments, both scheduled and unscheduled, to participants; and
(c)	regularly review and validate its margin system to ensure that it operates effectively and as intended.
4.10.7	The margin system of a Recognised Clearing House must, at a minimum:
(a)	establish margin levels which are commensurate with the risks and particular attributes of each product, portfolio, and market it serves, especially the risk of credit exposures posed by open positions of its Members or other participants using its facilities;
(b)	use a reliable source of timely price data for its margin system, and also procedures and sound valuation models for addressing circumstances in which pricing data is not readily available or reliable;
(c)	adopt initial margin models and parameters that are risk-based and generate margin requirements sufficient to cover its potential future exposure to Members and other participants using its facilities in the interval between the last margin collection and the close-out of positions following a participant default;
(d)	adopt a daily (and where appropriate, intra-day) calculation and collection policy of variation margin based on models and parameters that manages current and potential future exposures; and
(e)	analyse and review the performance of the margin model and overall margin coverage by:
(i)	conducting rigorous daily back-testing to evaluate whether there are any exceptions to its initial margin coverage at least monthly, and more frequently as appropriate;
(ii)	sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of varying important model parameters, including the most-volatile periods that have been experienced by the markets it serves and extreme changes in the correlations between prices; and
(iii)	an assessment of the theoretical and empirical properties of its margin model for all products it clears.
4.10.8	The initial margin established pursuant to Rule ‎4.10.7(c) must:
(a)	at the Member's portfolio level, be applied in respect of each portfolio's distribution of future exposure. If a Recognised Clearing House uses portfolio margining, it should continuously review and test offsets among products; 
(b)	at more granular levels, meet the corresponding distribution of future exposures; and
(c)	use models which, among other things:
(i)	rely on conservative estimates of the time horizons for the effective hedging or close-out of the particular types of products cleared by the Recognised Clearing House, including in stressed market conditions; and
(ii)	have an appropriate method for measuring credit exposure that accounts for relevant product risk factors and portfolio effects across products, and, to the extent practicable and prudent, limit the need for destabilising procyclical changes.
4.10.9	A Recognised Clearing House may allow offsets or reductions in required margin across products that it clears or between products that it and another Recognised Clearing House clear, if the risk of one product is significantly and reliably correlated with the risk of the other product.
4.10.10	Where two or more Recognised Clearing Houses are authorised to offer cross-margining, they must have appropriate safeguards and harmonised overall risk-management systems. 
4.11	Settlement finality
4.11.1	A Recognised Clearing House must have adequate arrangements to ensure clear and certain final settlement of payments, transfer instructions or other obligations of Members and other participants using its facilities and, where relevant, its own obligations. Where possible, a Recognised Clearing House should provide intra-day or real-time settlement finality to reduce settlement risk.
4.11.2	A Recognised Clearing House's arrangements for final settlement must:
(a)	ensure that, if intra-day or real-time settlement is not feasible, final settlement (of any payment, transfer instruction, or other obligation that has been submitted to and accepted by a Recognised Clearing House in accordance with its acceptance criteria) occurs at least by the end of the value date of the relevant transaction; and
(b)	clearly define the points:
(i)	at which the transfer instruction takes effect as having been entered into the system and when the final settlement occurs; 
(ii)	after which unsettled payments, transfer instructions, or other obligations may not be revoked by the parties to the underlying contract; and
(c)	prohibit the revocation by a Member, participant or other user of a transfer instruction from the point specified in accordance with sub-paragraph ‎(b)‎(ii).
4.11.2.Guidance	
For the purposes of this Rule:
(a)	"final settlement" is the irrevocable and unconditional transfer of an asset or Financial Instrument, or the discharge of obligations arising under the underlying contract by the parties to the contract; and
(b)	"value date" is the day on which the payment, transfer instruction, or other obligation arising under the underlying contract is due and, accordingly, the associated funds or Investments are available to the respective parties under the contract.
4.12	Segregation and portability
4.12.1	A Recognised Clearing House must have systems and procedures to enable segregation and portability of positions of the Clients of its Members and other participants on its facilities, and any collateral provided to it with respect to those positions. Such systems and procedures must enable the Recognised Clearing House to:
(a)	maintain the Client positions and any related collateral referred to in this Rule in individual Client accounts or in Omnibus Client Accounts; and
(b)	structure its portability arrangements so that the positions and collateral of a defaulting Member's or other participant's Clients can be transferred to one or more other Members or participants.
4.12.2	A Recognised Clearing House's systems and controls must, at a minimum, provide for the following:
(a)	the segregation and portability arrangements that effectively protect the positions and related collateral of the Clients of the Members or other participants on its facilities, from the default or insolvency of the relevant Member or other participants;
(b)	if the Recognised Clearing House offers additional protection of the Client positions and related collateral against the concurrent default of both the relevant Member or other participants or other Clients, the adoption of necessary measures to ensure that the additional protection offered is effective; and
(c)	the use of account structures that enable the Recognised Clearing House to readily identify assets and positions of the Clients of the relevant Member or other participant, and to segregate their related collateral.
4.12.3	The requirement to distinguish assets and positions in accounts in ‎4.12.2(a) is satisfied where:
(a)	the assets and positions are recorded in separate accounts;
(b)	the netting and positions recorded on different accounts is prevented; and
(c)	the assets covering the positions recorded in an account are not exposed to losses connected to positions recorded in another account. 
4.12.4	In relation to ‎4.12.2(a) above, a Recognised Clearing House must: 
(a)	keep separate records and accounts enabling its Members or participants to distinguish in accounts with the Recognised Clearing House its assets and positions from those held for the accounts of its Clients ('Omnibus Client Segregation'); or
(b)	keep separate records and accounts enabling its Members or participants to distinguish in accounts with the Recognised Clearing House the assets and positions held for the account of a specific Client from those held for the account of other Clients ('Individual Client Segregation'). If requested, the Recognised Clearing House must offer Members or participants the possibility to open more accounts in their own name or for the account of their Clients. 
4.12.5	A Recognised Clearing House must make available to its Members and other participants using its facilities, its Clearing Rules, policies and procedures relating to the segregation and portability of the positions and related collateral of the Clients of its Members and other participants using its facilities. This includes specifying the method for determining the value at which Client positions will be transferred.
4.12.6	A Recognised Clearing House should also disclose whether:
(a)	the segregated assets and/or Client collateral are held by the Recognised Clearing House or unaffiliated third-party custodians that hold assets on behalf of the Recognised Clearing House;
(b)	the Recognised Clearing House takes title transfer or if it takes a security interest, whether it has a right of use or re-use of Client collateral and when;
(c)	the Clients' collateral is protected on an individual or omnibus basis or a Clearing Member default for different accounts; and
(d)	there are any constraints, such as legal or operational, that may impair its ability to segregate or transfer a Member's or other participant's Clients' positions and related collateral.
4.12.7	In this section, assets refers to collateral held to cover positions and include the right to the transfer of assets equivalent to that collateral or the proceeds of the realisation of any collateral, but does not include default fund contributions.
4.12.8	In relation to a Remote Clearing House, this chapter does not prevent other customer segregation models being offered to Clearing Members outside the Abu Dhabi Global Market. In relation to clearing members of clearing houses incorporated outside the Abu Dhabi Global Market, this chapter does not require such clearing members to offer levels of segregation which are not made available by such clearing houses.  
4.13	Rules relating to Central Securities Depositories 
4.13.1	If a Recognised Clearing House also carries out functions of a Central Securities Depository, it may do so pursuant to its exemption or alternative may seek an additional registration as an Authorised Person solely in respect of its activities as a Central Securities Depository, provided that its Recognition Order includes a stipulation permitting it to do so. If the Recognition Order does include such a stipulation, the Rules that are applicable to Central Securities Depositories in COBS pursuant to COBS 10.2 will apply to that function, but that function only, and no other provisions of the Rulebook except MIR and such provisions of COBS shall apply.

/Table End
6	SUPERVISION
6.1	Suspension and removal of Financial Instruments from trading
6.1.1	The Regulator may for the purpose of protecting:  
(a)	the interests of investors; or
(b)	the orderly functioning of the ADGM Financial System,
require a Recognised Investment Exchange to suspend or remove a Financial Instrument from trading.
6.1.2	The Regulator may for the purposes of Rule 6.1.1(a) or (b) require a Recognised Clearing House to cease Clearing a Financial Instrument.
6.1.3	For the purposes of this chapter, any reference to the rules of a Recognised Body is made to its:
(a)	Business Rules, in the case of a Recognised Investment Exchange;
(b)	Clearing Rules, in the case of a Recognised Clearing House; and
(c)	Default Rules, as applicable.
6.1.3.Guidance	
The procedure the Regulator will follow if it exercises its power to require a Recognised Investment Exchange to suspend or remove a Financial Instrument from trading or Clearing is set out in Part 14 of FSMR. The procedure the Regulator will follow if it exercises its power to require a Recognised Clearing House to cease Clearing a Financial Instrument is set out in Part 14 of FSMR, as if references to Recognised Investment Exchanges were to Recognised Clearing Houses.  
6.1.4	If the Regulator exercises its power to require a Recognised Body to suspend or remove a Financial Instrument from trading or Clearing, it must as soon as reasonably practicable, publish its decision in such manner as it considers appropriate.
6.2	Information gathering power on Regulator's own initiative
6.2.1	While the Regulator will seek to obtain information from a Recognised Body in the context of an open, cooperative and constructive relationship with the Recognised Body, where it appears to the Regulator that obtaining information in that context will not achieve the necessary results, the Regulator or (as the case may be) its officers may, by notice in writing, require the Recognised Body or any Person who is connected to the Recognised Body to provide or produce specified information or information of a specified description, at a specified place and before the end of a reasonable period, in such form and with such verifications or authentications as it may reasonably require.
6.2.2	A Person is connected with a Recognised Body if he is or has at any relevant time been:  
(a)	a Member of the Recognised Body's Group; 
(b)	a Controller of the Recognised Body; 
(c)	any other member of a partnership of which the Recognised Body is a member; or
(d)	a Person mentioned in section 39 of FSMR, reading references in that Part to the "Authorised Person" as references to the Recognised Body.
6.3	Risk assessments for Recognised Bodies
6.3.1	For each Recognised Body, the Regulator will conduct a periodic risk assessment. This assessment will take into account relevant considerations including the special position of Recognised Bodies under the FSMR and the Rules, the nature of the Recognised Body's Members, the position of other users of its facilities and the business environment more generally.
6.3.2	[Deleted]
6.3.3	[Deleted]
6.3.3.Guidance	
6.3.3.Guidance.1.	Information is needed to support the Regulator's risk based approach to the supervision of all regulated entities, including Recognised Bodies. Risk based supervision is intended to ensure that the allocation of supervisory resources and the supervisory process are compatible with the Regulators objectives and the Regulator's general duties. The central element of the process of risk based supervision is a systematic assessment by the Regulator (a “risk assessment”) of the main supervisory risks and concerns for each regulated entity.
6.3.3.Guidance.2.	The risk assessment will guide the Regulator's supervisory focus. It is important, therefore, that there is good dialogue between the Regulator and the Recognised Body. The Regulator expects to review its risk assessment with the staff of the Recognised Body to ensure factual accuracy and a shared understanding of the key issues, and may discuss the results of the risk assessment with Key Individuals of the Recognised Body. If appropriate, the Regulator may send a detailed letter to the Recognised Body with proposals for further action or work to address particular concerns or issues and seek its comments on the risk assessment.
6.4	Complaints – Regulator’s arrangements
6.4.1	[Deleted]
6.4.2	The Regulator is required to have arrangements to investigate complaints which it considers relevant to the question of whether a Recognised Body should remain recognised as such. This section describes aspects of the Regulator's arrangements for investigating relevant complaints.
6.4.3	Where the Regulator receives a complaint about a Recognised Body, it will, in the first instance, seek to establish whether the complainant has approached the Recognised Body. Where this is not the case, the Regulator will ask the complainant to complain to the Recognised Body. Where the complainant is dissatisfied with the handling of the complaint, but has not exhausted the Recognised Body's own internal complaints procedures (in the case of a complaint against a Recognised Body, including by applying to that body's complaints investigator), the Regulator will encourage the complainant to do so.
6.4.4	The Regulator will not usually consider a complaint which has not, in the first instance, been made to the Recognised Body concerned, unless there is good reason for believing that it is a relevant complaint which merits early consideration by the Regulator.
6.4.5	When it is considering a relevant complaint, the Regulator will make its own enquiries as appropriate with the Recognised Body, the complainant and other Persons. It will usually ask the Recognised Body and the complainant to comment upon any preliminary or draft conclusions of its review and to confirm any matters of fact at that stage.
6.4.6	The Regulator will communicate the outcome of its review of a relevant complaint to the complainant and the Recognised Body, but will normally only discuss any action which it considers the Recognised Body should take with the Recognised Body itself.
6.5	Regulator supervision of action by Recognised Bodies under their Default Rules
6.5.1	[Deleted]
6.5.2	[Deleted]
6.5.2.Guidance	
6.5.2.Guidance.1.	Recognised Bodies which, under their rules, have Market Contracts are required to have Default Rules enabling them (among other things) to take action in relation to a Member that appears to be unable to meet its obligations in respect of one or more unsettled Market Contracts. The detailed Recognition Requirements relating to the Default Rules are set out in Rule ‎3.10 and Rule ‎4.5.
6.5.2.Guidance.2.	The Default Rules are designed to ensure that rights and liabilities between the defaulter and any counterparty to an unsettled Market Contract are discharged, and for there to be paid between the defaulter and each counterparty one net sum. The Insolvency Regulations contain provisions which protect action taken under Default Rules from the normal operation of insolvency law which might otherwise leave this action open to challenge by a Relevant Office Holder.
6.5.3	The Regulator may direct a Recognised Body to take, or not to take, action under its Default Rules (see Rules ‎6.5.4 and ‎6.5.6). Before exercising these powers the Regulator must consult the Recognised Body. The Regulator may also exercise these powers if a Relevant Office Holder applies to it.
6.5.4	The Regulator may issue a "positive" direction (to take action) where in any case a Recognised Body has not taken action under its Default Rules, but it appears to the Regulator that the Recognised Body could take action. 
6.5.5	Before giving such a direction under Rule 6.5.4, the Regulator shall consult the Recognised Body in question, and the Regulator shall not give a direction unless the Regulator is satisfied, in the light of that consultation that:
(a)	failure to take action would involve undue risk to investors or other participants in the market;
(b)	the direction is necessary having regard to the public interest in the financial stability of the Abu Dhabi Global Market; or 
(c)	the direction is necessary to facilitate a proposed or possible use of a power under chapter 16 of COBS or in connection with a particular exercise of a power under that chapter, or Rule 6.5.7(c).
6.5.6	The Regulator may issue a "negative" direction (not to take action) where in any case a Recognised Body has not taken action under its Default Rules, but it appears to the Regulator that the Recognised Body is proposing to take or may take action.
6.5.7	Before giving a direction under Rule 6.5.6, the Regulator shall consult the Recognised Body in question, and the Regulator shall not give a direction unless the Regulator is satisfied, in the light of that consultation that:
(a)	the taking of action would be premature or otherwise undesirable in the interests of investors or other participants in the market;
(b)	the direction is necessary having regard to the public interest in the financial stability of the Abu Dhabi Global Market; or
(c)	the direction is necessary to facilitate a proposed or possible use of a power under chapter 16 of COBS or in connection with a particular exercise of a power under that Part.
6.5.8	A negative direction cannot be given if, in relation to the defaulter, either:
(a)	a bankruptcy order or an award of sequestration of the defaulter's estate has been made, or an interim receiver or interim trustee has been appointed; or
(b)	a winding-up order has been made, a resolution for voluntary winding-up has been passed or an administrator, administrative receiver or provisional liquidator has been appointed,
and any previous negative direction will cease to have effect on the making or passing of any such order, award or appointment.
6.5.9	A negative direction may be expressed to have effect until a further direction is given, which may either be a positive direction or a revocation of the earlier negative direction.

6.5.10	Where a Recognised Body has taken action either of its own accord or in response to a direction, the Regulator may direct it to do or not to do specific things subject to these being within the powers of the Recognised Body under its Default Rules. However,
(a)	where the Recognised Body is acting in accordance with a direction given by the Regulator to take action on the basis that failure to take action would involve undue risk to investors or other participants in the market, the Regulator will not direct it to do or not to do specific things which the Recognised Body has power to do under its Default Rules, unless the Regulator is satisfied that this will not impede or frustrate the proper and efficient conduct of the default proceedings; and
(b)	where the Recognised Body has taken action under its Default Rules without being directed to do so, the Regulator will not direct it to do or not to do specific things which the Recognised Body has power to do under its Default Rules, unless the Regulator is satisfied that:
(i)	the direction will not impede or frustrate the proper and efficient conduct of the default proceedings; or
(ii)	the direction is necessary:
A.	having regard to the public interest in the stability of the Abu Dhabi Global Market Financial System;
B.	to facilitate a proposed or possible use of a power under COBS 16; or
C.	in connection with a particular exercise of a power under COBS 16. 
6.5.11	Where, in relation to a Member (or designated non-Member) of a Recognised Body:  
(a)	a bankruptcy order; 
(b)	an award of sequestration of his estate; 
(c)	an order appointing an interim receiver of his property; 
(d)	an administration or winding-up order; 
(e)	a resolution for a voluntary winding-up; or
(f)	an order appointing a provisional liquidator,
has been made or passed and the Recognised Body has not taken action under its Default Rules as a result of this event or of the matters giving rise to it, a Relevant Office Holder appointed in connection with the order, award or resolution may make an application to the Regulator.
6.5.12	The effect of such an application is to require the Recognised Body concerned to take action under its Default Rules or to require the Regulator to take action.
6.5.13	The procedure is that the Regulator must notify the Recognised Body of the application and unless the Recognised Body:
(a)	takes action under its Default Rules; 
(b)	notifies the Regulator that it proposes to take action forthwith; or
(c)	is directed to take action by the Regulator,
within three Business Days after receipt of that notice section 268 of the Insolvency Regulations will not apply in relation to Market Contracts to which the Member or designated non-Member is a party or to anything done by the Recognised Body for the purpose of, or in connection with, the settlement of Market Contracts.
6.6	Power to give directions
6.6.1	The Regulator has the power to give directions to a Recognised Body to take specified steps in order to secure its compliance with the Recognition Requirements. Those steps may include granting the Regulator access to the Recognised Body's premises for the purposes of inspecting those premises or any documents on the premises and the suspension of the carrying on of any activity by the Recognised Body for the period specified in the direction.
6.6.2	The Regulator is likely to exercise this power if it considers that:
(a)	there has been, or was likely to be, a failure to satisfy one or more of the Recognition Requirements which has serious consequences;
(b)	compliance with the direction would ensure that one or more of the Recognition Requirements is satisfied; and
(c)	the Recognised Body is capable of complying with the direction.
6.6.3	The Regulator need not follow the consultation procedure set out in Rule 6.9 or may cut short that procedure, if it considers it reasonably necessary to do so. 
6.7	Controllers – Notifications and powers to direct
6.7.1	A Recognised Body must comply with GEN 8.8.1 – 8.8.14 in relation to notifying changes relating to control.
6.7.2	The Regulator has the power to give a direction to a Recognised Body in matters relating to its Controllers if it considers that it is desirable to give the direction in order to advance one of more of its operational objectives.
6.7.3	In exercising or deciding whether to exercise its power to direct a Recognised Body in matters relating to its Controllers, the Regulator will have regard to any statement of policy published under this section and for the time being in force.
6.8	Power to revoke recognition
6.8.1	The Regulator has the power to revoke a Recognition Order relating to a Recognised Body, including when a Recognised Body has asked the Regulator to revoke a Recognition Order.
6.8.2	[Deleted]
6.8.3	The Regulator will usually consider revoking a Recognition Order if:
(a)	the Recognised Body is failing or has failed to satisfy one or more of the Recognition Requirements and that failure has or will have serious consequences; 
(b)	it would not be possible for the Recognised Body to comply with a direction under the Regulator's power to give directions under Rule 6.6.1; 
(c)	for some other reason, it would not be appropriate for the Regulator to give a direction under its power to give directions under Rule 6.6.1; or
(d)	the Recognised Body has not carried on the business of a Recognised Body during the 12 months beginning with the day on which the Recognition Order took effect in relation to it, or it has not carried on the business of a Recognised Body at any time during the period of six months ending with the day the Recognition Order is revoked.
6.8.4	The Regulator would be likely to consider the conditions in Rule ‎6.8.3(b) or Rule ‎6.8.3(c) to be triggered in the following circumstances:
(a)	the Recognised Body appears not to have the resources or management to be able to organise its affairs so as to satisfy one or more of the Recognition Requirements;

6.9.6	The procedures that the Regulator will follow in exercising its powers to make directions or refuse to make a Recognition Order (except in the case of a revocation of a Recognition Order, the Recognised Body concerned has given its consent or, in case where the Regulator proposes to make a direction, it considers it is reasonably necessary not to follow, or to cut short, the procedure) are:
/Table Start
	The Regulator will:	Guidance
1.		give written notice to the Recognised Body (or Applicant);	The notice will state why the Regulator intends to take the action it proposes to take, and include an invitation to make representations, and the period within which representations should be made (unless subsequently extended by the Regulator).
2.		receive representations from the Recognised Body or Applicant concerned;	The Regulator will not usually consider oral representations without first receiving written representations from the Recognised Body or Applicant.
