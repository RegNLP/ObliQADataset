The RBA requires a risk-based assessment of a Relevant Person's business, in Chapter \u200e6, and its customers, in Chapter \u200e7. A risk based assessment should be a dynamic process involving regular review, and the use of these reviews to establish the appropriate processes to match the levels of risk. No two Relevant Persons will have the same approach and implementation of the RBA and the AML Rulebook permits a Relevant Person to design and implement systems and controls that are appropriate to its business and customers, with the obvious caveat that such systems should be reasonable and proportionate in light of the money laundering risks. The Regulator expects the RBA to determine the breadth and depth of the Customer Due Diligence (\"CDD\") which is undertaken for a particular customer under Chapter \u200e8, though the Regulator understands that there is an inevitable overlap between the risk-based assessment of the customer in Chapter \u200e7 and CDD in Chapter \u200e8. This overlap may occur at the initial stages of onboarding of customers but may also occur when undertaking ongoing CDD.",

The disclosure framework for Mining Reporting Entities in Chapter 11 of MKT is substantially driven by three Mining Reporting Standards; the JORC Code, the SAMREC Code and NI 43-101 and the CIM Standards.  These Mining Reporting Standards set guidelines that provide for standardised definitions and a comprehensive classification system for Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves.  The FSRA intends for Chapter 11 of MKT to work closely, and be consistent, with the Mining Reporting Standards.  If there are any inconsistencies, however, between FSMR or MKT and the Mining Reporting Standards, FSMR or MKT will prevail.  However, this does not mean that where a Mining Reporting Standards requirement is not required under FSMR or MKT that it is acceptable for the Mining Reporting Standard requirement to be ignored.\n",
