The RBA requires a risk-based assessment of a Relevant Person's business, in Chapter \u200e6, and its customers, in Chapter \u200e7. A risk based assessment should be a dynamic process involving regular review, and the use of these reviews to establish the appropriate processes to match the levels of risk. No two Relevant Persons will have the same approach and implementation of the RBA and the AML Rulebook permits a Relevant Person to design and implement systems and controls that are appropriate to its business and customers, with the obvious caveat that such systems should be reasonable and proportionate in light of the money laundering risks. The Regulator expects the RBA to determine the breadth and depth of the Customer Due Diligence (\"CDD\") which is undertaken for a particular customer under Chapter \u200e8, though the Regulator understands that there is an inevitable overlap between the risk-based assessment of the customer in Chapter \u200e7 and CDD in Chapter \u200e8. This overlap may occur at the initial stages of onboarding of customers but may also occur when undertaking ongoing CDD."

A risk based assessment should be a dynamic process involving regular review, and the use of these reviews to establish the appropriate processes to match the levels of risk. No two Relevant Persons will have the same approach and implementation of the RBA and the AML Rulebook permits a Relevant Person to design and implement systems and controls that are appropriate to its business and customers, with the obvious caveat that such systems should be reasonable and proportionate in light of the money laundering risks. The Regulator expects the RBA to determine the breadth and depth of the Customer Due Diligence (\"CDD\") which is undertaken for a particular customer under Chapter \u200e8, though the Regulator understands that there is an inevitable overlap between the risk-based assessment of the customer in Chapter \u200e7 and CDD in Chapter \u200e8.

A risk based assessment should be a dynamic process involving regular review, and the use of these reviews to establish the appropriate processes to match the levels of risk. No two Relevant Persons will have the same approach and implementation of the RBA and the AML Rulebook permits a Relevant Person to design and implement systems and controls that are appropriate to its business and customers, with the obvious caveat that such systems should be reasonable and proportionate in light of the money laundering risks. The Regulator expects the RBA to determine the breadth and depth of the Customer Due Diligence (\"CDD\") which is undertaken for a particular customer under Chapter \u200e8, though the Regulator understands that there is an inevitable overlap between the risk-based assessment of the customer in Chapter \u200e7 and CDD in Chapter \u200e8.

Where the Insurer is a member of a Group, it may be practicable for some processes to be performed on a Group wide basis.  An Insurer would not normally outsource risk management systems outside the Group.  However the Insurer remains responsible under the Rules for the adequacy of its risk management systems, whether or not those processes are outsourced.  Senior management cannot delegate their regulatory responsibility for ensuring that the Insurer's risk management systems are adequate.  The fact that a system is partially or wholly outsourced would be a factor in the Insurer's assessment of whether the system was adequate.  To decide whether any system is adequate, senior management would be expected to have assessed the design and operation of the system, including the design and the operations of controls over outsourcing decisions and monitoring.  Because an Insurer must be in a position to demonstrate that it has complied with its regulatory requirements, adequate documentary evidence of these assessments should be maintained."

In the case of Authorised Persons facing financial risks, the requirements in this Chapter mandate completion of an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process. The Regulator will review the results of such internal risk assessments. This Chapter also sets out how the Regulator may impose an additional Capital Requirement on a firm specific basis in addition to the minimum requirement specified in Chapter 3 of these Rules to address higher-than-normal risk."

The RBA requires a risk-based assessment of a Relevant Person's business, in Chapter \u200e6, and its customers, in Chapter \u200e7. A risk based assessment should be a dynamic process involving regular review, and the use of these reviews to establish the appropriate processes to match the levels of risk. No two Relevant Persons will have the same approach and implementation of the RBA and the AML Rulebook permits a Relevant Person to design and implement systems and controls that are appropriate to its business and customers, with the obvious caveat that such systems should be reasonable and proportionate in light of the money laundering risks. The Regulator expects the RBA to determine the breadth and depth of the Customer Due Diligence (\"CDD\") which is undertaken for a particular customer under Chapter \u200e8, though the Regulator understands that there is an inevitable overlap between the risk-based assessment of the customer in Chapter \u200e7 and CDD in Chapter \u200e8. This overlap may occur at the initial stages of onboarding of customers but may also occur when undertaking ongoing CDD."

A risk based assessment should be a dynamic process involving regular review, and the use of these reviews to establish the appropriate processes to match the levels of risk. No two Relevant Persons will have the same approach and implementation of the RBA and the AML Rulebook permits a Relevant Person to design and implement systems and controls that are appropriate to its business and customers, with the obvious caveat that such systems should be reasonable and proportionate in light of the money laundering risks. The Regulator expects the RBA to determine the breadth and depth of the Customer Due Diligence (\"CDD\") which is undertaken for a particular customer under Chapter \u200e8, though the Regulator understands that there is an inevitable overlap between the risk-based assessment of the customer in Chapter \u200e7 and CDD in Chapter \u200e8.

Because the risk rating assigned to a customer resulting from this assessment determines the level of CDD that must be undertaken for that customer, this process must be completed before the CDD is completed for the customer. The Regulator is aware that in practice there will often be some degree of overlap between the customer risk assessment and CDD. For example, a Relevant Person may undertake some aspects of CDD, such as identifying Beneficial Owners, when it performs a risk assessment of the customer. Conversely, a Relevant Person may also obtain relevant information as part of CDD which has an impact on its customer risk assessment. Where information obtained as part of CDD of a customer affects the risk rating of a customer, the change in risk rating should be reflected in the degree of CDD undertaken."

On issuance, for example, the FSRA expects that Offers of Digital Securities to be limited/linked to an initial venue (e.g., MTF or RIE), due to the likelihood that permissioned access to a DLT will be limited due to commercial or technology compatibility issues.

As illustrated in paragraph 2.2, an authorised money remittance house does not need to apply for specific approvals from the FSRA to use Virtual Assets if it merely uses Virtual Assets as a medium of exchange to facilitate the remittance of fiat currencies on behalf of Clients across jurisdictions.  The Regulated Firm will, however, have to demonstrate that the use of the Virtual Asset, used in such ancillary manner, is fit for purpose, e.g., putting in place control requirements to address technology and security risks associated with the use of the Virtual Asset.  On the other hand, for example, if the Regulated Firm offers its Clients services to exchange Virtual Assets for fiat currencies, the Regulated Firm will need to apply to, and be authorised by, the FSRA to use Virtual Assets as part of its Regulated Activities.\n"

For in-scope ADGM companies \u2013 being ADGM companies meeting one or more of the Threshold Conditions - the RA has adopted a flexible \u2018comply or explain\u2019 approach to applicable disclosures.  In doing so, ADGM wishes to foster an ecosystem of companies which seek to help play a part in meeting the UAE\u2019s net zero by 2050 strategic initiative by disclosing the impact of their company\u2019s operations on ESG factors.\n\nThe RA will monitor whether the \u2018comply or explain\u2019 approach is effective in achieving the stated outcomes of the ESG Disclosures Framework.  In the future, the RA may decide to impose a mandatory ESG disclosures framework for in-scope entities. Nothing in this Guidance should be interpreted as an assurance that the \u2018comply or explain\u2019 approach will continue in the future.\n\n"

The fact that a system is partially or wholly outsourced would be a factor in the Insurer's assessment of whether the system was adequate.  To decide whether any system is adequate, senior management would be expected to have assessed the design and operation of the system, including the design and the operations of controls over outsourcing decisions and monitoring.

In essence, this Rule prevents an Insurer from counting as capital any surplus on participating contracts that is expected, under the terms of the contracts concerned, to accrue to the policyholders in the future.  Therefore, although attribution of surplus on participating contracts is discretionary, the Insurer must make a reasonable estimate, taking into account the perceived and reasonable expectations of policyholders.  Assumptions made in reaching this estimate (for example, on future investment income) should be consistent with those made for other purposes of the valuation.  However, the recognition of future bonuses or other forms of participation in this liability does not affect the determination of surplus for other purposes, such as allocation of bonuses of surplus prior to allocation of those bonuses."

For the former of these two purposes, the Insurer is identifying the pool, commonly known as surplus, that is available for allocation as bonuses (or equivalent) on participating policies.  The allocation then reduces the surplus (by convention, this is treated as occurring at the reporting date).  By contrast, for the latter of the two purposes, that portion of the remaining surplus that is expected to be allocated eventually to policyholders is also treated as a liability (in Rule \u200e5.6.7), on the grounds that it is not available to absorb losses of the Insurer.  For that purpose, declaration of bonuses merely represents a transfer from one recognised liability to another."

This means that where a Petroleum Reporting Entity is required to make a disclosure in relation to Petroleum activities under Rule 7.2.1, the information contained in the disclosure must not only comply with Rule 7.2.1 but also with any applicable Rules within Chapter 12.

Note, however, that with respect to Authorised Persons currently Operating an MTF (in relation to Virtual Assets), the FSRA will require the DSF to be a separate legal/operating entity from those entities it is providing settlement services (MIR Rule 3.8) and/or custody services (MIR Rule 2.10) for.  Migration of an independent Virtual Asset Custodian to being a DSF may therefore likely pose less operational/regulatory issues than an entity currently operating as both an MTF (in relation to Virtual Assets) and Virtual Asset Custodian.\n"

On issuance, for example, the FSRA expects that Offers of Digital Securities to be limited/linked to an initial venue (e.g., MTF or RIE), due to the likelihood that permissioned access to a DLT will be limited due to commercial or technology compatibility issues.

While working to build adequate internal capabilities in climate scenario development and analysis, financial firms may utilise relevant existing or emerging climate scenarios, whether global or regional, general or purpose-built.\n"
