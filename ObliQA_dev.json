Such assets may be held, for instance, through a special purpose or personal investment vehicle, a foundation, or similar.  Similarly, any real property held subject to an Islamic mortgage, where the lender has the legal title to the property, may be counted as indirectly held property of a Client, less the amount owing on the mortgage, where it is not a primary residence.  As the test is to determine the net assets (not gross assets) of an individual, any mortgages or other charges held over the property to secure any indebtedness of the individual should be deducted from the value of the assets.  If an individual who is an expatriate has a primary residence in his home country, such a residence should not generally be counted for the purposes of meeting the net asset test. However, if the current residence in the host country is owned by the individual, then that may be treated as their primary residence and the value of the residence in the home country of the individual may be counted for the purposes of meeting the net asset test, provided there is sufficient evidence of ownership and an objective valuation of the relevant premises. An Authorised Person should be able to demonstrate that it has objective evidence of the ownership and valuation of any assets taken into account for the purposes of meeting the net asset test.\n"

Because the risk rating assigned to a customer resulting from this assessment determines the level of CDD that must be undertaken for that customer, this process must be completed before the CDD is completed for the customer. The Regulator is aware that in practice there will often be some degree of overlap between the customer risk assessment and CDD. For example, a Relevant Person may undertake some aspects of CDD, such as identifying Beneficial Owners, when it performs a risk assessment of the customer. Conversely, a Relevant Person may also obtain relevant information as part of CDD which has an impact on its customer risk assessment. Where information obtained as part of CDD of a customer affects the risk rating of a customer, the change in risk rating should be reflected in the degree of CDD undertaken."

The Regulator is aware that in practice there will often be some degree of overlap between the customer risk assessment and CDD. For example, a Relevant Person may undertake some aspects of CDD, such as identifying Beneficial Owners, when it performs a risk assessment of the customer. Conversely, a Relevant Person may also obtain relevant information as part of CDD which has an impact on its customer risk assessment. Where information obtained as part of CDD of a customer affects the risk rating of a customer, the change in risk rating should be reflected in the degree of CDD undertaken."

A risk based assessment should be a dynamic process involving regular review, and the use of these reviews to establish the appropriate processes to match the levels of risk. No two Relevant Persons will have the same approach and implementation of the RBA and the AML Rulebook permits a Relevant Person to design and implement systems and controls that are appropriate to its business and customers, with the obvious caveat that such systems should be reasonable and proportionate in light of the money laundering risks. The Regulator expects the RBA to determine the breadth and depth of the Customer Due Diligence (\"CDD\") which is undertaken for a particular customer under Chapter \u200e8, though the Regulator understands that there is an inevitable overlap between the risk-based assessment of the customer in Chapter \u200e7 and CDD in Chapter \u200e8.

A risk based assessment should be a dynamic process involving regular review, and the use of these reviews to establish the appropriate processes to match the levels of risk. No two Relevant Persons will have the same approach and implementation of the RBA and the AML Rulebook permits a Relevant Person to design and implement systems and controls that are appropriate to its business and customers, with the obvious caveat that such systems should be reasonable and proportionate in light of the money laundering risks. The Regulator expects the RBA to determine the breadth and depth of the Customer Due Diligence (\"CDD\") which is undertaken for a particular customer under Chapter \u200e8, though the Regulator understands that there is an inevitable overlap between the risk-based assessment of the customer in Chapter \u200e7 and CDD in Chapter \u200e8.

A risk based assessment should be a dynamic process involving regular review, and the use of these reviews to establish the appropriate processes to match the levels of risk. No two Relevant Persons will have the same approach and implementation of the RBA and the AML Rulebook permits a Relevant Person to design and implement systems and controls that are appropriate to its business and customers, with the obvious caveat that such systems should be reasonable and proportionate in light of the money laundering risks. The Regulator expects the RBA to determine the breadth and depth of the Customer Due Diligence (\"CDD\") which is undertaken for a particular customer under Chapter \u200e8, though the Regulator understands that there is an inevitable overlap between the risk-based assessment of the customer in Chapter \u200e7 and CDD in Chapter \u200e8.

The Regulator is aware that in practice there will often be some degree of overlap between the customer risk assessment and CDD. For example, a Relevant Person may undertake some aspects of CDD, such as identifying Beneficial Owners, when it performs a risk assessment of the customer. Conversely, a Relevant Person may also obtain relevant information as part of CDD which has an impact on its customer risk assessment. Where information obtained as part of CDD of a customer affects the risk rating of a customer, the change in risk rating should be reflected in the degree of CDD undertaken."

The fact that the Listing Authority has discussed the matter with the Reporting Entity, sent the MAQ Letter and a Trading Halt or Suspension has not been applied for (either before or shortly after Disclosure by the Listing Authority of the MAQ Letter), is likely to create an expectation in the market that there is no Inside Information to be Disclosed.

For example, a Relevant Person may undertake some aspects of CDD, such as identifying Beneficial Owners, when it performs a risk assessment of the customer. Conversely, a Relevant Person may also obtain relevant information as part of CDD which has an impact on its customer risk assessment.

Where the Insurer is a member of a Group, it may be practicable for some processes to be performed on a Group wide basis.  An Insurer would not normally outsource risk management systems outside the Group.  However the Insurer remains responsible under the Rules for the adequacy of its risk management systems, whether or not those processes are outsourced.  Senior management cannot delegate their regulatory responsibility for ensuring that the Insurer's risk management systems are adequate.  The fact that a system is partially or wholly outsourced would be a factor in the Insurer's assessment of whether the system was adequate.  To decide whether any system is adequate, senior management would be expected to have assessed the design and operation of the system, including the design and the operations of controls over outsourcing decisions and monitoring.  Because an Insurer must be in a position to demonstrate that it has complied with its regulatory requirements, adequate documentary evidence of these assessments should be maintained."

Further guidance on the considerations applicable to entities wishing to operate as a DSF are set out in paragraphs 55 \u2013 61 above.  Note, however, that with respect to Authorised Persons currently Operating an MTF (in relation to Virtual Assets), the FSRA will require the DSF to be a separate legal/operating entity from those entities it is providing settlement services (MIR Rule 3.8) and/or custody services (MIR Rule 2.10) for.
