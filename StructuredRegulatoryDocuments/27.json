Apart from reports such as regular prudential returns, we may from time to time also request from a firm additional supplementary information and documents, including non-financial information such as a firm's internal policies on particular areas of risk and compliance.\n"

They enable us to test the soundness of the firm's systems and controls and the extent to which we can continue to rely on them and the firm's senior management to prevent or mitigate risks to our objectives. On-site visits will also assist us to assess the extent of supervision and the use of other supervisory tools required to address certain key risk areas.\n"

        "Passage": "The remedies for contraventions of the Tax Reporting Regulations are based on the financial penalties mandated by the relevant regulations themselves, deriving from a federal regime that applies across the UAE. The level of financial penalty to be imposed will usually be prescribed in the relevant Tax Reporting Regulations and depend upon the specific contravention identified. However, we have the power to impose additional penalties where appropriate to do so (for example, if the relevant regulations do not prescribe a penalty for the relevant contravention)."
