They take less time to wind down in the event of insolvency because Client Assets are easily identifiable, being held by a business that remains a going concern, has a direct relationship with the investor-client, and are protected from the claims of the Digital Investment Manager\u2019s creditors.

The Digital Investment Manager must carry out sufficient testing to demonstrate that its Model meets these principles.  Where appropriate (e.g. in the case of a complex Model), the FSRA may require a third-party audit to validate the performance outcomes of the Model as purported.\n"
