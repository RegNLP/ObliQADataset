The creation of and broadening of access to new data assets are in turn creating many new opportunities for both incumbent and start-up organisations. Fundamental to the development of this new paradigm is the \u201cAPI economy \u201d which facilitates efficient and secure access to data and processes held at different actors within the financial services sector.\n"
