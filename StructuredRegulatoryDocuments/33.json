        "Passage": "BACKGROUND\nThe diagram and table on the following pages set out the FSRA\u2019s regulatory approach in relation to the different types of digital asset activities within ADGM.\n/Figure Start\nThis figure presents a classification of Digital Assets as defined and regulated by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA), organized into four distinct categories: Other Digital Tokens, Virtual Assets, Digital Securities, and Fiat Tokens, with Derivatives/Funds being mentioned as an associated category. Below are the detailed descriptions of each:\n\nOther Digital Tokens: These are utility tokens which do not exhibit the features and characteristics of a regulated investment/instrument under FSRA.\n\nVirtual Assets: This category includes non-fiat virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin, Ether, etc. The figure notes that FSRA's market intermediaries conducting Virtual Asset business are required to apply and hold the relevant license under FSRA.\n\nDigital Securities: Described as digital assets with security characteristics, including 'tokenized' offerings of securities. Financial services activities in relation to Security Tokens - e.g., the offering of, dealing in, advising on, custody of, or providing Security Tokens - are regulated as Security instruments under FSRA.\n\nFiat Tokens: These are digital tokens that are fully backed by fiat currency. Some activities where tokens are used as payment instruments, e.g., stablecoins, may be regulated as Providing Money Services under FSRA.\n\nDerivatives/Funds: This refers to Derivatives over regulated Digital Assets and collective investment funds investing in Regulated Digital Assets. They are regulated as Derivatives and Funds in a Fund under FSRA.\n\nMarket operators and intermediaries dealing in such Derivatives and Funds are licensed and approved by FSRA.\n\nThe bottom note clarifies that the FSRA regulates and will allow to operate within the ADGM, the Digital Assets located within the blue dotted line and Derivatives over/Funds investing in Digital Assets. The blue dotted line encapsulates all categories except \"Other Digital Tokens,\" implying that all the other categories fall under the regulatory scope of FSRA within the ADGM (Abu Dhabi Global Market).\n/Figure End\n\n/Table Start\nCategory of Digital Assets / Instruments\tRegulatory Approach\n\u201cDigital Securities\u201d\n\n(e.g., digital/virtual tokens that have the features and characteristics of a Security under the FSMR (such as Shares, Debentures and Units in a Collective Investment Fund)).\nDeemed to be Securities pursuant to Paragraph 58(2)(b) of FSMR.\n\nAll financial services activities in relation to Digital Securities, such as operating primary / secondary markets, dealing / trading / managing investments in or advising on Digital Securities, are subject to the relevant regulatory requirements under the FSMR.\n\nMarket intermediaries and market operators dealing or managing investments in Digital Securities need to be licensed / approved by FSRA as FSP holders (including as Multilateral Trading Facilities), Recognised Investment Exchanges or Recognised Clearing Houses, as applicable.\n\n\u201cVirtual Assets\u201d\n\n(e.g., non-fiat virtual currencies,\nvirtual asset \u2018exchange tokens\u2019).\n\nTreated as commodities and, therefore, not deemed Specified Investments under the FSMR.\n\nMarket intermediaries (e.g., broker dealers, custodians, asset managers) dealing in or managing Virtual Assets, and Multilateral Trading Facilities using Virtual Assets, need to be licensed / approved by FSRA.  Only activities in Accepted Virtual Assets will be permitted.\n\nCapital formation activities are not provided for under the Virtual Asset Framework, and such activities are not envisaged under the Market Rules (MKT).\n\nDerivatives and Collective Investment Funds of Virtual Assets, Digital Securities and Utility Tokens\tRegulated as Specified Investments under the FSMR.\n\nMarket intermediaries and market operators dealing in such Derivatives and Collective Investment Funds will need to be licensed / approved by FSRA as FSP holders, Recognised Investment Exchanges or Recognised Clearing Houses, as applicable.\n\n\u201cUtility Tokens\u201d\n\n(e.g., tokens which can be redeemed for access to a specific product or service, typically provided using a DLT platform, do not exhibit the features and characteristics of a regulated investment / instrument under the FSMR).\nTreated as commodities and, therefore, not deemed Specified Investments under the FSMR.\n\nUnless such Utility Tokens are caught as Accepted Virtual Assets, spot trading and transactions in Utility Tokens do not constitute Regulated Activities, activities envisaged under a Recognition Order (e.g., those of a Recognised Investment Exchange or Recognised Clearing House), or activities envisaged under MKT.\n\n\n\u201cFiat Tokens\u201d\n\n(e.g. stablecoins whose value are fully backed by underlying fiat currencies)\tTreated as a form of digital representation of Fiat Currency.\n\nWhere used as a payment instrument for the purposes of Money Transmission as defined under the FSMR, the activity will be licensed and regulated as Providing Money Services.\n\n/Table End\n"

This means that the Prospectus should be written in a style that is appropriate for retail investors, and that the use of defined terms, technical language and market terminology should be restricted to circumstances where their use aids the comprehension of a retail investor, or where their use is necessary to ensure the Prospectus is true, accurate and not misleading.\n\nb)\tRisk Factors: Pursuant to MKT Appendix 1.1.1-2.3, proper consideration is to be given to the real risks that face an Issuer, and generic or boilerplate disclosures are to be avoided. If a risk is not relevant to a particular Issuer, or its Digital Securities, then it is expected that no disclosure of that risk be included in the Issuer\u2019s Prospectus. Risk factors should be grouped together in a coherent manner and risk factors considered to be of the greatest or most-immediate significance should be disclosed prominently at the beginning of the risk factors section.\n\nc)\tResponsibility: As per MKT Rule 4.10, an Issuer or the Person making a Prospectus Offer remains responsible for all disclosures within a Prospectus and ensuring that the disclosures within a Prospectus are clear and not misleading.\n\nd)\tGeneral Information: As set out in MKT Appendix 1.1.1-1.1, the country of incorporation of the Issuer and its incorporation number should be clearly disclosed within the Prospectus. A statement should be included on whether the Issuer has been established as a special purpose vehicle or entity for the purpose of issuing asset backed Securities.  In the context of Digital Securities, the FSRA would generally view digital representations (such as tokens) of Debentures or notes backed by financial assets to be considered asset backed for the purpose of this disclosure requirement. Please note that the disclosure requirement in Securities Note \u2013 7.1 also applies.\n\ne)\tActual and proposed business activities: As set out in MKT Appendix 1.1.1-2.1, a description of the history of the Issuer is to be included, and where an Issuer is newly incorporated, information should be disclosed regarding any preceding entity which conducted similar operations or was controlled by the same parties.\n\nf)\tHistorical financial information: As set out in MKT Appendix 1.1.1-7.1, where an Issuer has begun operations, its relevant financial information is to be included in the Prospectus, and be appropriately audited.  An Issuer\u2019s financial statements are to be prepared in compliance with IFRS. As set out in MKT Appendix 1.1.1-9.4, please also note that the requirement for an expert report applies to special categories of Companies.\n\ng)\tSecurities Note: For the purposes of MKT Appendix 1.2.1 \u2013 Section 2 (General information relating to the Securities (b)&(d)), in the case of Digital Securities, the FSRA would normally expect this disclosure requirement to be deemed N/A for the former, and subject to ADGM legislation for the latter.\n\nh)\tSecurities Note \u2013 Other rights: Pursuant to MKT Appendix 1.2.1 \u2013 2.4, the disclosure of other rights (such as the existence of voting rights) associated with a Digital Security is an important disclosure to allow an investor to make a fully informed investment decision. As such, disclosures of this nature would need to be given due prominence within an Approved Prospectus, and effort needs to be made throughout the document to draw a reader\u2019s attention to such disclosures. This may involve cross-referencing or other appropriate signposting.\n"

On issuance, for example, the FSRA expects that Offers of Digital Securities to be limited/linked to an initial venue (e.g., MTF or RIE), due to the likelihood that permissioned access to a DLT will be limited due to commercial or technology compatibility issues. The implication therefore is that where an MTF or RIE, for example, controls access to a distributed ledger there may be a limit/restriction on an investor to transfer Digital Securities to another investor. This is in contrast to Virtual Assets (for example, Bitcoin), where access to the Bitcoin distributed ledger is not permissioned.\n"
