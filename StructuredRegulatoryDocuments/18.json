        "Passage": "Risk profile.\tVC Funds typically invest in small, minority equity positions in small ventures that are not traded on public markets.  They typically utilize little or no leverage when acquiring their investments, which tend to be far smaller than investments made by private equity funds.  VC Funds are also closed-ended, and do not in practice permit investors to make ongoing subscriptions or redemptions at their discretion once the funds have completed the subscription period , thereby reducing liquidity risk.  As such, VC Managers and the VC Funds they manage generally pose lower systemic and contagion risks, and should therefore give rise to fewer market impact concerns in the event of their failure."

        "Passage": "Clients.\tAs investments in VC Funds are risky in nature, investors in VC Funds are Professional Clients which possess higher levels of financial sophistication and financial resources. VC Fund investors anticipate that many of the Early Stage entities the VC Fund invests in will fail: however, they also expect that at least a few investments will generate significant returns and make the entire fund profitable overall.  In addition, VC Managers typically invest their own financial resources in the VC Fund alongside their investors, as they earn money primarily from their own investments rather than management / advisory fees.  This common exposure to the risks of each investment by the VC Fund ensures that a VC Manager has its interests aligned with those of its investors .  Therefore, VC Managers should generally present fewer concerns in relation to investor protection and conduct risks arising from any potential for conflicts of interest."

        "Passage": "Regulatory Capital.\tUnlike traditional Fund Managers, the capital of VC Managers is largely invested in Early Stage entities.  As a VC Manager does not necessarily operate on steady streams of revenue earned from management / advisory fees, the ongoing financial health of the VC Manager is very much dependent on the valuation of its illiquid investments which can only be realized on divestment. Consequently, it may not be meaningful to impose the standard capital requirements on a VC Manager, as long as it has the ability to meet its liabilities as they fall due.  In addition, given that most successful VC Managers are serial entrepreneurs who have accumulated their financial resources through successful exits, the track record and experience of the principal(s) in a VC Manager is equally important in assessing the ongoing viability of that VC Manager than is the case for traditional fund managers."

        "Passage": "Governance and controls.\tThe nature of VC Fund investments is such that traditional internal governance and control structures may not be appropriate or relevant for a VC Manager.  Traditional fund managers are typically required to have an independent valuation function for the fund. As most early-stage fund investments may not be generating revenues or may not yet be profitable, the investment decisions of a VC Manager hinge very much on the qualitative assessment and expert judgment of the individual manager, rather than conventional financial models.  Valuation of early-stage investments is typically subjective, and is to a large extent determined by investor appetite during the actual funding rounds of the Early Stage entities. As periodic valuation of a VC Fund\u2019s assets based upon traditional cash flow or balance sheet models cannot take into consideration the unique, speculative nature of the fund\u2019s investments, the benefit  of imposing conventional control structures on a VC Manager is generally not proportionate compared to the cost of doing so."

        "Passage": "Co-investments. A \u201cco-investment\u201d is an investment that is made alongside, but not as part of, a Fund\u2019s investment into a target company. Generally speaking, a VC Fund Manager typically seeks co-investments where to do so would, for example, allow a Fund to participate in an offered private equity stake in a target entity that it would otherwise not qualify for or to assist an investee company to increase its committed capital raise.  The Regulator is of the view that a VC Manager may, in the course of is business, seek to arrange co-investments and offer advice to co-investors.  In order to do so, a VC Manager will also need a Financial Services Permission to carry out one or both of the additional activities of Regulated Activities of \u201cAdvising on Investments or Credit\u201d and \u201cArranging Deals in Investments\u201d. A VC Manager may apply for a Financial Services Permission including one or both of those Regulated Activities and remain within the scope of the VC Framework, provided that the additional Regulated Activities are limited to activities necessary to bring about co-investments in an investee company of a VC Fund which the VC Manager manages."
