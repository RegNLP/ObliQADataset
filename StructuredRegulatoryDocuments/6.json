Either the official mid-market price or the last trade price should provide an appropriate basis of valuation for the Fund. The Fund Manager should, however, document the choice of methodology and ensure that the procedures are applied consistently and fairly; and\nb.\twhere there has been no recent trade in the Security concerned, or no reliable price exists, an Investment should be valued at a price which, reflects a fair and reasonable price for that investment. For example, a Fund Manager may obtain a valuation from three experienced brokers and average the value. In such cases, the Fund Manager is required to document the reasons for his decision and should be prepared to justify any assumptions made."
