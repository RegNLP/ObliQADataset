Spot Commodity markets, however, frequently operate with little to no regulatory oversight, leaving them exposed to Market Abuse and Financial Crime, amongst other regulatory issues.  Furthermore, given the connectivity of Spot Commodity markets to the wider financial system through Financial Instruments (including Derivatives), market intermediaries and supply chain financing, there are contagion risks to the stability, and operations, of the wider financial system.  Examples of harm resulting from Spot Commodity market risks include the significant losses for banking institutions from the financing of fraudulent Spot Commodity inventories, and participants using Inside Information (from Spot Commodity markets) to profit in Commodity Derivative markets.  Financial sector rules intended to prevent such abuse are often limited in scope or unenforceable, further harming market participants and consumers, and the ultimate integrity of Spot Commodity markets as a whole.\n"

Particular regard is given to due diligence over mandatory labour, environmental and such supply chain controls, as well as the enforceability of rules preventing the use of conflict minerals.\n\nAuthorised Persons will be required to demonstrate provisions for third-party audits of producers\u2019 environmental and occupational health and safety practices and investigatory and enforcement powers, as well as grievance mechanisms whereby third parties can report potential instances of non-compliance.\n\nMarket Fundamentals\n\n(COBS Rule 22.2.2(b))\nThe FSRA will consider the size of the Spot Commodity market, including its market practices, liquidity, depth and breadth of demand, the number of active participants, and the controls/processes to manage volatility of a particular Spot Commodity (for transparency and fair and orderly trading purposes).\n\nDelivery Soundness\n\n(COBS Rule 22.2.2(c))\nThere are a wide range of practices related to the storage of Spot Commodities, which vary by type of Spot Commodity, trading venue, and jurisdiction.  The FSRA requires Accepted Spot Commodity storage and delivery mechanisms to adhere to appropriate standards, including alignment with IOSCO\u2019s Good and Sound Practices , with particular regard for oversight, transparency, conflicts of interest, fees and incentives and operations.\n\nFungibility\n\n(COBS Rule 22.2.2(c))\nThe FSRA requires Accepted Spot Commodities to be able to be delivered and be freely replaceable by another of a similar nature or kind for the purposes of the relevant contract (or is normally regarded as such in the Spot Commodities market), the two goods will be fungible in nature for these purposes.\n\nSanctions and Anti Money Laundering\n\n(AML and COBS Rule 22.2.2(c))\nThe FSRA requires Accepted Spot Commodities to have had appropriate due diligence and controls relating to Sanctions and Anti Money Laundering in relation to any delivery in accordance with applicable laws.\n\nDelivery Jurisdiction\n\n(COBS Rule 22.2.2(c))\nThe FSRA requires Accepted Spot Commodities to be delivered in jurisdictions where the storage or delivery facility operates under rules and regulations deemed, by the FSRA, to have equivalent standards as with those of Abu Dhabi Global Market and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nSpot Commodities that are produced, processed, stored, delivered, owned, financed or otherwise associated with jurisdictions that are subject to international or regional sanctions, as well as jurisdictions considered as having strategic Anti Money Laundering and Financial Crime deficiencies, will not be permitted.\n\nThe FSRA may also recognise, for all requirements set out in this paragraph 26, where a Spot Commodity, or Spot Commodity Activities generally, are regulated by an IOSCO Member.\n\n/Table End\n\n"

Given the limited level of industry oversight and licencing requirements, cash transactions have the potential to provide criminal groups with a continuous supply of untraceable Spot Commodities from various sources.  Furthermore, this supply can be purchased at below market cost, directly from market participants who do not have to prove how they own the Spot Commodity.  The high-volume of transactions conducted through these cash-intensive businesses can be easily falsified or co-mingled with the proceeds of crime, while the purchased Spot Commodity (such as gold) can be used to make untraceable settlements for illicit goods and services.  Due to a significant number of Spot Commodities purchases being conducted in cash, large numbers of transactions are undertaken anonymously;\n\nb)\tThe majority of ML offences relating to commodity markets are associated with international trading, with it being easy to physically convert some Spot Commodities into different forms, in order to conceal from, or understate to, border authorities the value on the shipping documentation, such as bills of lading;\n\nc)\tThe exact amount of Spot Commodities activity is difficult to identify, as smuggling is an ideal method of moving it from one location to the next, either domestically or to international jurisdictions, where it can then be converted for use on secondary markets.  Criminals may recruit couriers to move commodities across borders both legally and illegally.  This allows criminals to remain anonymous and distance themselves from a transfer;\n\nd)\tDue to the nature of Spot Commodity markets, the Spot Commodity itself does not have to exist, or be moved physically, to be traded.  Rather, citing the Spot Commodity as the traded good on an invoice can be used to justify large movements of money, either domestically or across borders; and\n\ne)\tComponents of Spot Commodity production, such as refining, smelting or shipping, may be located in jurisdictions that do not have adequate ML/TF controls.\n"

        "Passage": "REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - SPOT COMMODITY ACTIVITIES\nAnti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance. When considering the FATF Recommendations, in combination with the application of the AML Rules, the FSRA notes the following key principles that an Authorised Person conducting Regulated Activities using Spot Commodities should consider:\n\nPrinciple 1: Risk Based Approach\n\na)\tFATF expects countries, regulators, financial institutions and other concerned parties to adopt a \u2018Risk Based Approach\u2019 (\u201cRBA\u201d).  Authorised Persons are expected to understand the risks associated with their activities and allocate proper resources to mitigate those risks.  A RBA can only be achieved if it is embedded into the compliance culture of the Authorised Person, which enables the Authorised Person to make decisions and allocate appropriate resources in the most efficient and effective way.\n\nb)\tAuthorised Persons should, on a periodic basis, carry out a proper risk based assessment of their processes and activities.  In order to implement the RBA, Authorised Persons are expected to have processes in place to identify, assess, monitor, manage and mitigate ML risks.  The general principle is that in circumstances where there are higher risks of ML, Authorised Persons are required to implement enhanced measures to manage and mitigate those risks.\n\nc)\tWith the use of Spot Commodities being largely unregulated within financial services, any financial institution banking an Authorised Person conducting Regulated Activities using Spot Commodities must not only satisfy itself, but also its foreign correspondent financial institution(s), that the Authorised Person is well regulated and has appropriate systems and controls in place to address ML, TF and sanctions risks.  These systems and controls should include robust processes to carry out \u2018customer risk assessment\u2019 and \u2018customer due diligence\u2019 checks (collectively, \u201cCDD\u201d) on Clients and beneficial owners, to monitor transactions for these risks, and the willingness and ability of the Authorised Person to provide complete transparency to its financial institution(s) and foreign correspondent financial institution(s) if and when required.\n\nPrinciple 2: Business Risk Assessment\n\nd)\tChapter 6 of the AML Rules requires Relevant Persons to take appropriate steps to identify and assess the ML risks to which their businesses are exposed, taking into consideration the nature, size and complexity of their activities.  Importantly, in the context of Spot Commodities, FATF Recommendation (15) states that:\n\n\u201cCountries and financial institutions should identify and assess the money laundering or terrorist financing risks that may arise in relation to (a) the development of new products and new business practices, including new delivery mechanisms, and (b) the use of new or developing technologies for both new and pre-existing products. In the case of financial institutions, such a risk assessment should take place prior to the launch of the new products, business practices or the use of new or developing technologies. They should take appropriate measures to manage and mitigate those risks.\u201d\n\ne)\tAnother aspect of assessing the business risk relevant to Authorised Persons is gaining familiarity with the characteristics and terminology  of the Spot Commodity industry.  Additionally, Authorised Persons, and their management and staff, should be aware of the possible misuse of Spot Commodities in criminal activities, as well as the physical nature of Spot Commodities (including delivery and storage facilities).\n\nf)\tWhen making its assessment, an Authorised Person must give consideration to all business risks.  For example, while an issue may be identified in relation to delivery soundness, the FSRA expects Authorised Persons to consider these risks from all perspectives to establish whether the risk triggers other issues for consideration (including ML/TF risks, technology governance and consumer protection).  An Authorised Person must then use the identified risks to develop and maintain its AML/CTF policies, procedures, systems and controls and take all reasonable steps to eliminate or manage such risks.\n\nPrinciple 3: Due Diligence\n\ng)\tThe Authorised Person, where it is operating an MTF or OTF, is to assess whether a potential Member is adequately regulated in its home jurisdiction, such that the Authorised Person can suitably rely on its Members, to undertake Customer Risk Assessment and CDD checks.  Where Members/Clients are not properly regulated, the FSRA expects that MTFs or OTFs will centralise the relevant compliance activities internally (and not be able to rely on their \u2018members\u2019 for such purposes).\n\nh)\tCDD rules, policies and procedures are required to be implemented by all Authorised Persons.  Authorised Persons should have a process to ensure its Members (and/or in relevant circumstances, itself) assess all Clients according to the Client\u2019s risk profile (and taking into consideration the Authorised Person\u2019s RBA).  This risk-based assessment is required to be undertaken for each Client prior to transacting any business on behalf of the Client.  Authorised Persons must, as applicable, ensure CDD is undertaken for each Client and comply in full with Chapter 8 of the AML Rules noting that the FSRA does not consider it appropriate for Authorised Persons (or its Members, as applicable) to use simplified CDD when conducting Regulated Activities using Accepted Spot Commodities.\n\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\n\ni)\tAuthorised Persons are required to implement an appropriate governance structure, especially in relation to physical due diligence, and provide for the development and maintenance of all necessary controls to ensure appropriate ML and TF compliance.\n\nj)\tThe FSRA expects Authorised Persons to act responsibly and always be vigilant in ensuring that their activities are not subject to any misuse by participants with Spot Commodities that may have been tainted in any way from illegal or unethical sourcing.  The FSRA expects that an Authorised Person\u2019s internal processes establish the types of \u2018indicators\u2019 or activities that could be used to identify when Accepted Spot Commodities may have been used or sourced in an illegal manner.\n\n"
