        "Passage": "As a progressive regulator, the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) recognises the transformative power of the virtual asset (VA) industry and its potential to facilitate access to innovative financial services. In response, we created the world\u2019s first bespoke and comprehensive regulatory framework designed for virtual asset activities in 2018. It stands distinct from our other publications covering Digital Assets more broadly which, in addition to VAs, includes the digitalisation of financial services and capital markets, including in relation to Digital Securities."

The rapid growth of the VA sector and evolution of its enabling technology has seen financial regulators across the globe responding with a variety of approaches, including but not limited to prohibition, restrictions and forbearance. The FSRA believes that bringing definable VA activities within its regulatory perimeter ensures greater oversight and mitigation of the risks inherent in the sector. This approach also addresses the expectations of both best-in-class innovators and traditional financial institutions that seek the transparency and consistency of a regulated environment for a nascent asset class."

As a forward-looking regulator, the FSRA implemented these safeguards at the outset to prevent the commensurate increase in risk as the sector undergoes expansion within ADGM. Therefore, the following risk drivers receive heightened focus from the FSRA in its supervisory programme:\n(a)\tCustody of VAs \u2013 even where outsourced to a third party, a VA custodian is held to the requirements applicable to client monies and client investments. Enhanced reconciliation and reporting requirements are also in place.\n(b)\tTechnology and Governance Controls \u2013 whilst being \u2018technology-neutral\u2019, we have bespoke requirements reflecting the intensive technology-related operations of VA firms, including: the maintenance of operating systems; cryptographic keys and wallet storage; password encryption; origin/destination of VA funds; and fork protocols.\n(c)\tExchange-Type Operations \u2013 the \u2018fair and orderly trading\u2019 and Market Abuse requirements for Financial Instruments admitted to trading on trading venues in ADGM are equally applicable to VAs traded on an MTF in ADGM.
