These conditions and a small number of additional ones have been translated into Rules via chapter 23 of the Conduct of Business Rulebook (\u201cCOBS 23\u201d) and associated guidance therein.  In addition, we are issuing this supplementary guidance to inform Authorised Persons and potential applicants of the further criteria that we expect those firms to meet in order to be allowed to offer these products to Retail Clients."

Qualitative criteria the FSRA would examine are the experience and qualifications of the individuals proposed for the following positions.\na)\tSenior Executive Officer - a minimum of ten years\u2019 experience in dealing with Retail Clients in respect of similar products in an equivalently regulated environment and holding a directly relevant qualification and membership of appropriate professional body.\nb)\tLicensed Director, whether executive or non-executive - a minimum of seven years\u2019 experience in dealing with Retail Clients in respect of similar products in an equivalently regulated environment and holding a directly relevant qualification and membership of appropriate professional body.\nc)\tSenior Managers - a minimum of five years\u2019 experience in dealing with Retail Clients in respect of similar products in an equivalently regulated environment and holding a directly relevant qualification and membership of appropriate professional body.\nd)\tCompliance Officer, Money Laundering Reporting Officer - a minimum of five years\u2019 experience in dealing with Retail Clients in respect of similar products in an equivalently regulated environment and holding a directly relevant qualification and membership of an appropriate professional body."
