A number of financial services regulators have issued comments or consumer alerts setting out their regulatory position on virtual tokens and/or Virtual Assets.

        "Passage": "The FSRA adopts a technology-neutral approach to regulation, where regulatory requirements are applied to the conduct of Regulated Activities or activities envisaged under a Recognition Order , as opposed to the technological means to conduct a Regulated Activity.  To the extent that virtual tokens are used as a mechanism to enable or facilitate a Regulated Activity to be carried out, they are generally permitted.  For example, subject to fit and proper safeguards, an authorised money remittance house may receive fiat currencies from Clients and use virtual tokens to securely remit an equivalent value overseas directly to a regulated foreign counterparty via the internet in real-time; the foreign counterparty can then pay out in fiat currencies to the intended end-clients."

Reliable information regarding the issuer, and what it plans to do with the funds raised may be lacking.  The risk of fraud and loss of capital is therefore significantly higher.  This is particularly likely to be the case where a token issuer promises extremely high investment returns that are disproportionately high relative to those generally available in the market.

As illustrated in paragraph 2.2, an authorised money remittance house does not need to apply for specific approvals from the FSRA to use Virtual Assets if it merely uses Virtual Assets as a medium of exchange to facilitate the remittance of fiat currencies on behalf of Clients across jurisdictions.  The Regulated Firm will, however, have to demonstrate that the use of the Virtual Asset, used in such ancillary manner, is fit for purpose, e.g., putting in place control requirements to address technology and security risks associated with the use of the Virtual Asset.  On the other hand, for example, if the Regulated Firm offers its Clients services to exchange Virtual Assets for fiat currencies, the Regulated Firm will need to apply to, and be authorised by, the FSRA to use Virtual Assets as part of its Regulated Activities.\n"
