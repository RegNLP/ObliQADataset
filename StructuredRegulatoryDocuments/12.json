The Regulator retains the power to prohibit or limit the inclusion of such features in a Long Term Insurance contract where it is of the view that the inclusion of such features may have a materially adverse impact upon the long term viability of the Insurer.  It is natural for Insurers to seek to stimulate a market by offering features such as guarantees or options.  However, the solvency of Insurers could be threatened if they have not adequately valued, stress tested and set aside adequate capital to service such features.  Therefore, the Regulator will expect Insurers seeking permission to write contracts with such features to demonstrate that these steps have been undertaken, and that their procedures provide adequately for ongoing monitoring of the associated risks.  Permission to undertake such business may be subject to conditions, for example, a requirement to maintain additional capital, or to restrict business of this nature to a specific proportion of its total business.  The Regulator may also as a condition of granting permission require additional information relating to the business in question to be reported to the Regulator in the Insurer's periodic Regulatory Returns, or in the Actuary's report referred to in Rule \u200e7.3.4.\n"

Since persistency may be volatile, it is considered imprudent for an Insurer to rely upon 'lapse support' in its valuation.  However, voluntary discontinuance of policies may increase a valuation as well as reduce it (for example, a guaranteed surrender value may exceed the actuarially calculated liability for part of the life of the contract).  In performing the valuation, the insurer should therefore make prudent allowance for the effect of lapses, surrenders, and related policyholder actions where these increase the valuation.  The impact may vary over the life of a particular contract; for example, lapse at one stage in the contract life may represent a cost to the Insurer, whereas at another, it may represent a benefit."

In essence, this Rule prevents an Insurer from counting as capital any surplus on participating contracts that is expected, under the terms of the contracts concerned, to accrue to the policyholders in the future.  Therefore, although attribution of surplus on participating contracts is discretionary, the Insurer must make a reasonable estimate, taking into account the perceived and reasonable expectations of policyholders.  Assumptions made in reaching this estimate (for example, on future investment income) should be consistent with those made for other purposes of the valuation.  However, the recognition of future bonuses or other forms of participation in this liability does not affect the determination of surplus for other purposes, such as allocation of bonuses of surplus prior to allocation of those bonuses."

However, if the application for a waiver is made some time after authorisation was granted, the Regulator may request confirmation that there has been no material change to the information originally supplied;\n(ii)\twhere the ISPV is not authorised, the Regulator will expect to receive confirmation that the ISPV is subject to regulation by a Regulator in a jurisdiction acceptable to the Regulator.  In addition, it will need details of the debt issuance or other financing mechanism by which the ISPV's reinsurance liabilities are funded.  The Regulator will also expect to receive information about the ISPV's key management and control functions, including details of the ISPV's auditors and arrangements for claims handling, and any material outsourcing agreements.  The Regulator will also need information about the structure of any Group of which the ISPV is a member;\n(iii)\tno credit will be allowed for a contract of reinsurance with an ISPV unless there is an effective transfer of risk to the ISPV.  The Regulator will require evidence that the contract of reinsurance and the extent of the credit that the Insurer proposes to take for it satisfy the risk transfer principle; and\n(iv)\tthe Regulator will also expect to receive an analysis of the potential for risk to revert to the Insurer or any of its associates under realistic adverse scenarios or for liabilities to arise in respect of the risks transferred for which no provision has been made.\n"

For the former of these two purposes, the Insurer is identifying the pool, commonly known as surplus, that is available for allocation as bonuses (or equivalent) on participating policies.  The allocation then reduces the surplus (by convention, this is treated as occurring at the reporting date).  By contrast, for the latter of the two purposes, that portion of the remaining surplus that is expected to be allocated eventually to policyholders is also treated as a liability (in Rule \u200e5.6.7), on the grounds that it is not available to absorb losses of the Insurer.  For that purpose, declaration of bonuses merely represents a transfer from one recognised liability to another."

However the Insurer remains responsible under the Rules for the adequacy of its risk management systems, whether or not those processes are outsourced.  Senior management cannot delegate their regulatory responsibility for ensuring that the Insurer's risk management systems are adequate.  The fact that a system is partially or wholly outsourced would be a factor in the Insurer's assessment of whether the system was adequate.  To decide whether any system is adequate, senior management would be expected to have assessed the design and operation of the system, including the design and the operations of controls over outsourcing decisions and monitoring.  Because an Insurer must be in a position to demonstrate that it has complied with its regulatory requirements, adequate documentary evidence of these assessments should be maintained."

In the case of General Insurance, reinsurance recoveries anticipated in respect of those liabilities are generally recognised as a separate asset.  In the case of Long Term Insurance, Insurance Liabilities include also the net value of future Policy Benefits and the effects of reinsurance arrangements are taken into account when these are estimated."
