        "Passage": "GENERAL INTRODUCTION\n\u201cThe Common Reporting Standard (CRS), developed in response to the G20 request and approved by the OECD Council on 15 July 2014, calls on jurisdictions to obtain information from their financial institutions and automatically exchange that information with other jurisdictions on an annual basis. It sets out the financial account information to be exchanged, the financial institutions required to report, the different types of accounts and taxpayers covered, as well as common due diligence procedures to be followed by financial institutions.\nThe Standard consists of the following four key parts:\n\u2022\tA model Competent Authority Agreement (CAA), providing the international legal framework for the automatic exchange of CRS information;\n\u2022\tThe Common Reporting Standard;\n\u2022\tThe Commentaries on the CAA and the CRS; and\n\u2022\tThe CRS XML Schema User Guide.\u201d\nFor the purposes of the UAE CRS Regulations, the Common Reporting Standard Commentary and FAQs, which is any explanatory material made and published by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) for the purpose of assisting with the interpretation of the Common Reporting Standard, is an integral part of the Common Reporting Standard and accordingly applies for the purposes of the automatic exchange of financial account information.\nThe UAE Financial Institutions should consult documentation issued, from time to time, by the OECD for clarification and the CRS commentary and FAQs, for example:\n\u2022\tStandard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters\n\u2022\tStandard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters - Implementation Handbook\n\u2022\tCRS FAQs.\nThe above documents are published on the OECD website: http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/common-reporting-standard/ and https://www.oecd.org/tax/exchange-of-tax-information/."

The MAC was ratified according to Federal Law No. 54 of 2018 and the MCAA according to Federal Law No. 48 of 2018. The MCAA contains the rules on the exchange of information between the UAE Competent Authority and partner jurisdiction Competent Authorities. The confidentiality, safeguards and the existence of the necessary infrastructure for an effective exchange are all covered by the MCAA.\nBoth agreements are legal instruments for the implementation of the international OECD standard of Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) - CRS for tax purposes.\nThe Ministry of Finance, which is the UAE Competent Authority, is in charge of the CRS implementation according to the Cabinet Decision.\nThe UAE CRS Regulations will be published by the Regulatory Authorities concerning the UAE Financial Institutions (as defined in the UAE CRS Regulations):\n\u2022\tCentral Bank\n\u2022\tSecurities and Commodities Authority (SCA)\n\u2022\tInsurance Authority\n\u2022\tRegistrar of Companies, Dubai International Financial Centre (ROC)\n\u2022\tFinancial Services Regulatory Authority, Abu Dhabi Global Markets (FSRA)\n\u2022\t[ ]\n"
