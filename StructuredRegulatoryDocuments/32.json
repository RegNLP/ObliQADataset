        "Passage": "The Regulator has enacted rules to ensure that Fund Managers of Private Credit Funds implement and maintain suitable systems and controls to address risk, including, but not limited to, the following.\n\n/Table Start\nRequirement\tNote\nRisk Appetite Statement\tThe Fund Manager of a Private Credit Fund must develop, state and adhere to a risk appetite statement for the Fund.  Typically this will drive a Private Credit Fund\u2019s investment policy as stated in the Prospectus and Constitution of the Fund.\nThe risk appetite statement is necessary in order that potential investors in the Fund may understand the type and nature of the Credit Facilities and debt instruments that the Fund intends to invest in and the credit risk profile of the borrowers that the Fund is seeking.\nLending Processes\tThe Fund Manager of a Private Credit Fund must implement and maintain processes to ensure investments in Credit Facilities are only made based on a stated credit risk assessment and pricing methodology.\nThe Regulator understands that such methodologies may differ amongst Fund Managers of Private Credit Funds in line with the stated risk appetite strategy for their respective Funds, and that lending criteria may differ from the standards adopted by conventional lenders.  The Regulator will expect, however, a Fund Manager to be able to demonstrate robust, defined criteria for lending and how such criteria and methods will operate in practice.\nRisk Management\tThe Fund Manager of a Private Credit Fund is expected to employ techniques that are appropriate to the risks facing the Fund, including, but not limited ongoing credit and concentration risk.\nFund Managers will inevitably seek to assess the credit risk of each potential borrower as part of its lending process and will also need to demonstrate how they will measure and mitigate those risks on an ongoing basis. Therefore, the Regulator will expect Fund Managers to be able to demonstrate systems and controls that allow changes in the credit risk profile of borrowers to be identified over the duration of each Credit Facility.\nStress Testing\tThe Fund Manager of a Private Credit Fund must employ stress testing methodologies in order to identify risks that may affect the Fund\u2019s portfolio in adverse scenarios.\nThe Fund Manager must therefore be able to demonstrate to the Regulator that it has systems in place that enable it to regularly stress test the Fund\u2019s portfolio against potential adverse events and market conditions (and combinations thereof).  The Fund Manager must also be able to demonstrate a strategy to allow the Fund to mitigate those risks and to take appropriate action should the identified adverse scenarios arise.\n/Table End"
