The disclosure framework for Mining Reporting Entities in Chapter 11 of MKT is substantially driven by three Mining Reporting Standards; the JORC Code, the SAMREC Code and NI 43-101 and the CIM Standards.  These Mining Reporting Standards set guidelines that provide for standardised definitions and a comprehensive classification system for Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves.  The FSRA intends for Chapter 11 of MKT to work closely, and be consistent, with the Mining Reporting Standards.  If there are any inconsistencies, however, between FSMR or MKT and the Mining Reporting Standards, FSMR or MKT will prevail.  However, this does not mean that where a Mining Reporting Standards requirement is not required under FSMR or MKT that it is acceptable for the Mining Reporting Standard requirement to be ignored.\n"
