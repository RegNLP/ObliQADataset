        "Passage": "Conflicts of interest. When assessing its systems and controls in relation to conflicts of interest, a Recognised Body should have regard to the following:\n(a)\tA conflict of interest arises in a situation where a Person with responsibility to act in the interests of one Person may be influenced in his action by an interest or association of his own, whether Personal or business or employment related. Conflicts of interest can arise both for the Employees of Recognised Bodies and for the members (or other Persons) who may be involved in the decision-making process, for example where they belong to committees or to the Governing Body. Conflicts of interest may also arise for the Recognised Body itself as a result of its connection with another Person.\n(b)\tThe Regulator recognises that a Recognised Body has legitimate interests of its own and that its general business policy may properly be influenced by other Persons (such as its owners). Such a connection does not necessarily imply the existence of a conflict of interest nor is it necessary to exclude individuals closely connected with other Persons (for example, those responsible for the stewardship of the owner's interests) from all decision-making processes in a Recognised Body. However, there may be decisions, primarily regulatory decisions, from which it may be appropriate to exclude an individual in certain circumstances where an interest, position or connection of his conflicts with the interest of the Recognised Body.\n(c)\tA Recognised Body should make arrangements to structure itself and to allocate responsibility for decisions so that it can continue to take proper regulatory decisions notwithstanding any conflicts of interest, including the:\n(i)\tsystems and controls intended to ensure that confidential information is only used for proper purposes;\n(ii)\tsize and composition of the Governing Body and relevant committees;\n(iii)\troles and responsibilities of Key Individuals, especially where they also have responsibilities in other organisations;\n(iv)\tarrangements for transferring decisions or responsibilities to alternates in individual cases; and\n(v)\tarrangements to ensure that individuals who may have a permanent conflict of interest in certain circumstances are excluded from the process of taking decisions (or receiving information) about matters in which that conflict of interest would be relevant."
