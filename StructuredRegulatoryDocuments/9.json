Although PSIAs have the characteristics of a Collective Investment Fund, under an express exclusion provided under paragraph 63 of Schedule 1 to FSMR, they are not treated as such.

Takaful is derived from an Arabic word that means joint guarantee, whereby a group of participants agree among themselves to support one another jointly for the losses arising from specified risks. In a Takaful arrangement the participants contribute a sum of money as a Tabarru\u2019 commitment into a common fund that will be used mutually to assist the members against a specified type of loss or damage. The underwriting in Takaful is thus undertaken on a mutual basis, similar in some respects to conventional mutual insurance. A typical Takaful Provider consists of a two-tier structure that is a hybrid of a mutual and a commercial form of company although in principle it could be a pure mutual structure.  The Takaful Operator\u2019s role is generally confined to managing the Takaful activities and investing the fund assets in accordance with Shari'a."

There are two types of Regulated Activities that comprise insurance business: Effecting Contracts of Insurance as principal or Carrying Out Contracts of Insurance as Principal. Accordingly, any Authorised Person carrying on these Regulated Activities is subject to the ADGM regime for regulating Regulated Activities. Where an Authorised Person carries out the activities described under Effecting Contracts of Insurance or Carrying Out Contracts of Insurance as Principal in connection with Takaful such Authorised Person will be subject to the ADGM regime for regulating Regulated Activities and, in addition, will be subject to the Takaful-specific requirements set out in this Rulebook (see IFR \u200e8).  In addition, there are certain activities relating to insurance, such as advising and arranging, which are regulated as Insurance Intermediation as defined in Chapter 4 of Schedule 1 to FSMR. Authorised Persons conducting those activities in relation to Takaful are regulated in the same way as Authorised Persons conducting such activities in relation to conventional insurance."

        "Passage": "Family Takaful deals with the provision of financial relief to the participants and/or their family in the event of misfortunes that relate to the death or disability of the participants. This category of Takaful normally requires the Takaful Operator to engage in a longer-term relationship over a defined number of years with the Takaful participants, throughout which the participant is required to make regular instalment payments in consideration for his or her participation in the Takaful scheme."

        "Passage": "In Family Takaful, the paid Takaful contribution of a participant will usually be segregated into two accounts which feed two different funds. The first is the Participants' Investment Fund (PIF), and the aggregate PIFs constitute an investment fund for the purposes of capital formation. The second is the Participants' Risk Fund (PRF), which is a risk fund; that is, an element of the business that is inherent in the underwriting activities, and the contributions to which are made on the basis of Tabarru' commitment."

        "Passage": "Nevertheless, there are some Family Takaful products, such as group Takaful or term Takaful, that do not necessarily involve a long-term relationship between the Takaful undertakings and the Takaful participants. These products offer a shorter period of coverage and, as such, they have no investment element in favour of the participants. Normally, these types of products would work on a similar mechanism to General Takaful, whereby all Takaful contributions are considered as Tabarru' and credited directly into the PRF."

        "Passage": "An Authorised Person Managing a PSIA, on an unrestricted basis is subject to a unique type of risk referred to as Displaced Commercial Risk. This risk reflects the fact that an Authorised Person may find itself under commercial pressure to pay a rate of return to its PSIA holders which is sufficient to induce those investors to maintain the investment of their funds in an Unrestricted PSIA managed by the Authorised Person, rather than withdrawing those funds from the Unrestricted PSIA and investing them elsewhere. If this \"required\" rate of return is higher than that which would be payable under the normal terms of the PSIA Investment Contract, the Authorised Person may be under pressure to forgo some of the share of profit which would normally have been attributed to an Authorised Person and, by extension, be available for distribution to its shareholders (e.g. part of the Mudarib's share of the profits of a Mudaraba). Failure to do this might result in a volume of withdrawals of funds by investors large enough to jeopardise the Authorised Person's commercial position (or, in an extreme case, its solvency). Thus, part of the commercial risk attached to the returns attributable to the PSIA is, in effect, transferred to the shareholders of the Authorised Person or the Authorised Person's own capital. It also reflects situations whereby an investor may be permitted to exit an investment in a particular asset pool at par where the fair value of such assets is lower than their carrying amounts resulting in the Authorised Person absorbing the loss arising as a result of such shortfall."
