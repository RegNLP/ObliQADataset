An ADGM Climate Transition Portfolio must invest predominantly in assets meeting the Climate Transition Portfolio Investment Requirement. The Regulator is cognisant that it may take time to acquire certain Eligible Climate Transition Portfolio Assets. At a minimum, the Regulator expects that assets meeting the Climate Transition Portfolio Investment Requirement will constitute:\na)\tMore than 50% of the Model Portfolio\u2019s assets within two years of the date on which an ADGM Climate Transition Portfolio Designation is granted; and\nb)\t75% or more of the Model Portfolio\u2019s assets within five years of the date on which an ADGM Climate Transition Portfolio Designation is granted."
