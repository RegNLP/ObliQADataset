Frequent revaluation is prudent, and the revaluation of marketable Securities should occur on at least a daily basis. Furthermore, measures of the potential unsecured Exposure under collateralised transactions should be calculated under stressed and normal conditions. One such measure would take account of the time and cost involved if the obligor or Counterparty were to default and the Collateral had to be liquidated. Furthermore, the setting of limits for collateralised Counterparties should take account of the potential unsecured Exposure. Stress tests and scenario analysis should be conducted to enable the Authorised Person to understand the behaviour of its portfolio of CRM arrangements under unusual market conditions. Any unusual or disproportionate risk identified should be managed and controlled."

For the purposes of this Chapter and App4, \"securitisation\" includes Traditional Securitisation, Synthetic Securitisation and Re securitisation, as defined below:\n(a)\tA Traditional Securitisation is a structure where the cash flow from an underlying pool of Exposures is used to service at least two different stratified risk positions or tranches reflecting different degrees of Credit Risk. Payments to the investors depend upon the performance of the specified underlying Exposures, as opposed to being derived from an obligation of the entity originating those Exposures. A Traditional Securitisation will generally assume the movement of assets off balance sheet.\n(b)\tA Synthetic Securitisation is a structure with at least two different stratified risk positions or tranches that reflect different degrees of Credit Risk where Credit Risk of an underlying pool of Exposures is transferred, in whole or in part, through the use of funded (e.g. CLNs) or unfunded (e.g. credit default swaps) Credit Derivatives or guarantees that serve to hedge the Credit Risk of the portfolio. Accordingly, the investors' potential risk is dependent upon the performance of the underlying pool. A Synthetic Securitisation may or may not involve the removal of assets off balance sheet.\n(c)\tA Re securitisation Exposure is a securitisation Exposure in which the associated underlying pool of Exposures is tranched and at least one of the underlying Exposures is a securitisation Exposure. In addition, an Exposure to one or more Re securitisation Exposures is a Re securitisation Exposure."

        "Passage": "\nThis Section complements the Rules and Guidance set out in other sections of this Chapter with more specific guidance for the identification, assessment, control and monitoring of Operational Risks in trading activities. In this Guidance, reference to \"trading activities\" should be construed in its natural sense in the context of Regulated Activities and should include an Authorised Person's activities in Dealing in Investments as Principal and Dealing in Investments as Agent. In addressing the Operational Risks arising from trading activities, an Authorised Person should consider the following:\na.\tstaff members in support and control functions, comprising functions such as operations, settlement, finance, risk management, legal, compliance, internal and external audit, should have adequate representation and authority within the Authorised Person's overall governance framework so as to be able to effectively challenge the activities undertaken by the front office;\nb.\tOperational Risk management systems should set criteria, indicators and thresholds enabling the identification of material incidents detected by internal control procedures. This should include tracking of Operational Risk losses in trading activities and analysis of those losses for possible interconnections (i.e. losses based on one event or root cause);\nc.\thigh professional standards and a sound risk culture should be promoted within the Authorised Person, particularly in the front office, in a way that supports professional and responsible behaviour. This should include, but is not limited to, developing and implementing appropriate policies and procedures, setting standards (often in the form of a \"code of conduct\") for relations between traders and their counterparts, and training procedures;\nd.\tthere should be adequate segregation of duties between front office and the support and controls functions in charge of supporting, verifying and monitoring trade transactions;\ne.\tappropriate policies and procedures relating to leave requirements and staff movements should be developed, implemented and regularly monitored; in particular:\ni.\tprocedures establishing a minimum absence requirement of at least two consecutive weeks' leave for traders (via a vacation, \"desk holiday\" or other absence from the office or trading) so that traders are physically unable to mark or value their own books, this responsibility being carried out by a different Person during those periods; and\nii.\tEmployees changing job positions between front, middle and back offices or IT should be properly tracked.\nf.\tterms of reference describing the activity of each trader or group of traders should be established. Adherence to these terms should be subject to monitoring by support and control functions;\ng.\tdocumentation requirements for trading activities should be properly defined so as to minimise legal uncertainties in enforceability of contracts with clients and Counterparties. This should include consideration of using contracts that are standardised as far as possible, particularly in OTC transactions;\nh.\tall trading positions, profits and losses, cash flows and calculations associated with a transaction should be clearly recorded in the Authorised Person's management information systems with a documented audit trail. The audit trail should allow for the tracing of cash flows at a sufficiently granular level (e.g. traders, books, products and portfolios);\ni.\tappropriate procedures for confirmation of the terms and conditions of transactions with external Counterparties/clients should be established;\nj.\tappropriate processes and procedures should be implemented for the settlement of transactions. This should include consideration of the following elements:\ni.\tthe authorisation of inputs by the back office;\nii.\tpayment/settlements carried out against independent documents;\niii.\treconciliation between front office and back office systems; and\niv.\treconciliation procedures independent of the processing functions.\nk.\tcontrols should include daily reconciliation of positions and cash flows across various internal systems and external parties. The reconciliations should include all events attached to the transactions including amendments, cancellation, exercises, resets and expiries;\nl.\tprocedures and processes should be established to ensure accurate and timely monitoring and follow up of margin or Collateral calls;\nm.\tprofit attribution is a key control for understanding the risk in a trading operation and therefore the control and support functions should have a good understanding of the various aspects that lead to P&L generation, particularly in relation to more complex products. Major implausibilities discovered within the P&L in the context of the trading mandate and market developments should be further analysed to see if they are caused by Operational Risk events; and\nn.\tcontrol procedures should be established to monitor and escalate unusual transactions, anomalies in confirmation and reconciliation processes, errors in recording, processing and settling transactions, along with cancellations, amendments, late trades and off market rates."

The appropriateness of the market inputs for the particular position being valued should be reviewed regularly;\nc.\twhere available, generally accepted valuation methodologies for particular products should be used as far as possible;\nd.\twhere the model is developed by the Authorised Person itself, it should be based on appropriate assumptions, which have been assessed and challenged by suitably qualified parties independent of the development process. The model should be developed or approved independently of the front office. It should be independently tested. This includes validating the mathematics, the assumptions and the software implementation;\ne.\tthere should be formal change control procedures in place and a secure copy of the model should be held and periodically used to check valuations;\nf.\trisk management should be aware of the weaknesses of the models used and how best to reflect those in the valuation output;\ng.\tthe model should be subject to periodic review to determine the accuracy of its performance (e.g. assessing continued appropriateness of the assumptions, analysis of profit and loss versus risk factors, comparison of actual close out values to model outputs); and\nh.\tvaluation adjustments should be made as appropriate, for example, to cover the uncertainty of the model valuation (see also valuation adjustments in Guidance notes 6 to 14.)\n"

The Authorised Person should model the yield curves using one of a number of generally accepted approaches, for example, by estimating forward rates of zero coupon yields. For material Exposures to interest rate risk in the major currencies and markets, the yield curve should be divided into a minimum of six maturity segments, to capture the variations of volatility of rates along the yield curve.

For Collective Investment Funds the actual foreign exchange positions of the Fund should be taken into account.

The model must also capture the risk of less than perfectly correlated movements between similar, but not identical, commodities and the Exposure to changes in forward prices arising from Maturity Mismatches. It should also take account of market characteristics, notably delivery dates and the scope provided to traders to close out positions; For more actively traded portfolios, the model should also take account of variation in the \"convenience yield\" between Derivative positions such as forwards and swaps and cash positions in the commodity; and\ne.\tthe Authorised Person's internal model should conservatively assess the risk arising from less liquid positions and positions with limited price transparency under realistic market scenarios. In addition, the internal model should meet minimum data standards.
