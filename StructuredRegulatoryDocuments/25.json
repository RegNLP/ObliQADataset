        "Passage": "Purpose of the ESG Disclosures Framework\n\nThe RA\u2019s ESG Disclosures Framework seeks to encourage good practice by ADGM companies in disclosing applicable information on ESG factors in line with a globally recognised disclosures standard.\n\nThe ESG Disclosures Framework may be applied by all ADGM entities on a voluntary basis.  For in-scope ADGM companies \u2013 being ADGM companies meeting one or more of the Threshold Conditions - the RA has adopted a flexible \u2018comply or explain\u2019 approach to applicable disclosures.  In doing so, ADGM wishes to foster an ecosystem of companies which seek to help play a part in meeting the UAE\u2019s net zero by 2050 strategic initiative by disclosing the impact of their company\u2019s operations on ESG factors.\n\nThe RA will monitor whether the \u2018comply or explain\u2019 approach is effective in achieving the stated outcomes of the ESG Disclosures Framework.  In the future, the RA may decide to impose a mandatory ESG disclosures framework for in-scope entities. Nothing in this Guidance should be interpreted as an assurance that the \u2018comply or explain\u2019 approach will continue in the future.\n\n"
