It is important to note that, pursuant to section 50 of FSMR, only the FSRA can maintain an Official List of Securities, and neither Recognised Investment Exchanges (RIEs) nor any other entity within ADGM are able to maintain their own \u2018Official List of Securities\u2019.  Section 50 of FSMR further provides that in maintaining the Official List, the FSRA may refer to itself as the Listing Authority.  For this purpose, Chapter 7 of MKT sets out the Rules applicable to \u2018Market Disclosure\u2019 or otherwise known as its \u2018continuous disclosure\u2019 framework.  This Guidance sets out the Listing Authority\u2019s expectations in relation to its continuous disclosure framework, and provides guidance to Reporting Entities to assist their decision making in relation to their continuous disclosure obligations.\n"

This will clearly, therefore, raise the question of whether the Reporting Entity is intending to disclose the report for promotional reasons, rather than as required under Rule 7.2.1.

Depending on the nature of the information requested, the Listing Authority may require the information to be Disclosed.  The Listing Authority may, but is not required to, notify a Reporting Entity of the proposed Disclosure and allow the Reporting Entity an opportunity to comment.  If the Reporting Entity believes that the information it provides to the Listing Authority is Inside Information, but which falls within the exemption from immediate Disclosure under Rule 7.2.2, the Reporting Entity must submit to the Listing Authority reasons for why it has formed that belief (at the time the relevant Inside Information is provided to the Listing Authority).\n"
