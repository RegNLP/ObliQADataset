Whether the Financial Instrument will fall out of the index depends on the closing price of the Financial Instrument on a particular day.  B places a large sell order in this Financial Instrument just before the close of trading on that day.

The order is to be executed near the close of the last trading day of the quarter.  His purpose is to position the price of those Shares at an artificial level; and\n(d)\tan entity, A, purchases a large number of Shares of an Issuer on its initial public listing.  In the period between that listing and the end of A's financial year, the price of the Issuer's Shares declines significantly.  Near the close of market on the date of A's financial year end, a broker acting for A enters several bids to buy Shares in the Issuer.  The bid prices are well above those at which the Shares had been trading and have the effect of significantly increasing the closing price of the Shares.

The trader fails to Offer to lend the crude oil back to other market participants at a reasonable commercial rate.  The trader then unwinds his position in the Exchange's final settlement window  at rapidly increasing prices, thereby cornering/squeezing the crude oil market.  His conduct causes an abnormal movement in the price of crude oil contracts for forward month delivery; and\n(b)\ta trader with a long position in bond futures, buys or borrows a large amount of the bonds and either refuses to re-lend these bonds or will only lend them to parties he believes will not re-lend to the market.  His purpose is to position the price at which persons with short positions have to deliver to satisfy their obligations at a materially higher level, making him a profit on his position."

A passes this information on to family members who instruct their broker to sell their Shares in the Company.

Before the new joint venture is disclosed to the market, B buys Shares in his employer Company based on his expectation that the price of the Shares will rise significantly once the new joint venture is announced;\n(c)\tC, an Employee of a firm that is providing advisory services to a Company D (an Authorised Person), becomes aware of negotiations for a Takeover of D that is likely to be announced to the market imminently. C buys Shares in D based on his expectation that the Takeover will soon be announced;\n(d)\tD, a dealer on the trading desk of an Authorised Person dealing in Derivatives, accepts a large order from a Client to acquire a long position in Futures. Before executing the order, D trades for the firm and on his personal account by taking a long position in those Futures, based on his expectation that he will be able to sell them at profit due to the significant price increase that will result from the execution of his Client's order. Both trades would contravene section 92(2) (Insider Dealing); and\n(e)\tInvestment bank E has been in discussions with an Issuer about a potential issue of new Financial Instruments by the Issuer.

His purpose is to ensure that portfolio account statements sent to the Client show the value of the portfolio to be higher than its actual value, in order to induce the Client to provide funds to purchase further Financial Instruments or Accepted Virtual Assets.\nThe Regulator notes that some of the above examples may also contravene other sections such as section 102 (misleading statements).\n"
