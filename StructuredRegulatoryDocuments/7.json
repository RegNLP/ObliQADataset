For example, where practicable, the measurement of performance should be set in a multi year framework. If this is not practicable, there should be deferral of vesting of the benefits or retention or claw back arrangements applicable to such components as appropriate;\nd.\tthere are appropriate prudential limits, consistent with the Authorised Person or Recognised Body's capital management strategy and its ability to maintain a sound capital base taking account of the internal capital targets or regulatory capital requirements;\ne.\tin the case of Employees involved in the distribution of financial products whose Remuneration is Commission based, there are adequate controls and monitoring to mitigate marketing which is solely Commission driven; and\nf.\tthe use of guaranteed bonuses is generally avoided as such payments are not consistent with sound risk management and performance based rewards.
